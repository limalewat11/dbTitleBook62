The late April sky was leaden gray and the young leaves on the live oak trees hung limp and unmoving in the languid Saturday afternoon air. Lizzy hadn&#x2019;t checked the thermometer beside the back door of the Darling Dahlias&#x2019; clubhouse, but she&#x2019;d bet dollars to doughnuts that the temperature was nudging ninety. And judging from the weight of the air and the way her blue blouse was sticking to her shoulders, the humidity was way up there, too. She glanced nervously toward the clouds in the west, which were tinged with a darker, more ominous purple. As she watched, a flash of lightning zigzagged from the base of the cloud.</p><p>Lizzy raised her voice to the women working in the large vegetable garden next to the clubhouse. All three of them&#x2014;Ophelia Snow, Verna Tidwell, and Bessie Bloodworth&#x2014;were club officers. Ophelia was the vice-president and secretary; Verna was treasurer; and Bessie was the newly elected club historian.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, everybody. Let&#x2019;s finish up as soon as we can. We don&#x2019;t want to be out here in the open when that storm hits.&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, Bessie put a hand to her back and straightened up, glancing toward the west. &#x201c;Gracious, Liz,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;That looks like a lollapalooza.&#x201d; She frowned down at the row she was hoeing. &#x201c;I guess these beans can wait. But we&#x2019;d better plan on putting in some sort of trellis. Kentucky Wonders are like Jack&#x2019;s beanstalk. They aim for the skies. If we wait much longer, we&#x2019;ll have a mess of snaky green vines all over the ground.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Those are the seeds your cousin sent you from Birmingham?&#x201d; Lizzy asked. Good seeds weren&#x2019;t always easy to buy. The best often came from friends and family.</p><p>Bessie nodded. &#x201c;She saved them from her last year&#x2019;s garden. Says they&#x2019;re the best green beans she&#x2019;s ever grown.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we can come up with some cane poles and twine for a trellis,&#x201d; Lizzy said. She glanced back at the clouds. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s work on it later. I&#x2019;m not worried about getting wet&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t melt&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t like for us to be out in the garden when the lightning is flashing.&#x201d; She was remembering poor Mr. Burdette, who had been struck dead by lightning when he walked out to the pasture to bring the cows home for milking one afternoon. Spring storms could be violent.</p><p>Bessie gave the sky another apprehensive glance. &#x201c;And let&#x2019;s hope for no hail,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d sure hate to see all our little plants beaten to death.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just put in two more rows of okra, Liz,&#x201d; Verna called, coming along the path. She turned and pointed toward the far side of the garden, where an unpainted board fence and a row of crepe myrtles marked the edge of the clubhouse property. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s room for three more rows. By the time we get done planting, there&#x2019;ll be enough okra to feed everybody in Darling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the point, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Ophelia asked. &#x201c;Enough for everybody?&#x201d; Ophelia had a hoe in one hand and a rake in the other, and her round, sweet face was sweat-streaked and dirty.</p><p>&#x201c;There can never be enough okra,&#x201d; Bessie said emphatically.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; Ophelia said. To Lizzy, she added, &#x201c;The last of the English peas will need to be picked in the next few days, Liz. They&#x2019;ve stopped blooming, so that will be our final picking. And there are more carrots and beets to pull.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;I hope everybody comes to help, the way they did last time. It&#x2019;s a lot more fun when we have a good turnout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Many hands make light work,&#x201d; Bessie observed sensibly, and Lizzy smiled. She imagined Bessie&#x2019;s brain as a massive library of adages that were filed under various headings, at least one for every occasion. Of course, as the unofficial historian for the town of Darling, Bessie had many other things filed away in her mind, such as important events in the past, historically important sites, and family trees.</p><p>Verna sniffed. &#x201c;It would be nice if we would all show up,&#x201d; she remarked, with an edge to her voice.</p><p>Lizzy knew what Verna was thinking. The Dahlias had hosted a work party two weeks before, and thirteen out of the fourteen club members had attended. (Mrs. George E. Pickett Johnson was the missing person. She had offered to send her colored maid, Flossie, but Lizzy had declined. She knew Flossie and liked her, but she thought that Mrs. Johnson should come herself, not send her paid help.) Some of the Dahlias had picked and shelled peas, some had harvested lettuce and the last of the spring spinach, and some had pulled carrots, beets, and green onions. There was plenty for the Dahlias to share, as well as a big batch of fresh produce for the Saturday-morning farmers market, where they had a table. What they didn&#x2019;t sell, they gave away when the market closed. Lizzie had noticed that some of the poorer folks hung around until closing time and were glad to get whatever they could.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to organize another garden party, I guess,&#x201d; Lizzy said. Organizing came easily to her&#x2014;the reason, she supposed, that she&#x2019;d just been elected for another term as club president. &#x201c;This time, maybe Mrs. Johnson will come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget that we also have to organize a planting party at the cemetery next week,&#x201d; Bessie cautioned. &#x201c;Miss Rogers will never forgive us if we don&#x2019;t get those Confederate roses into the ground before the Confederate Day ceremony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>,&#x201d; Verna and Ophelia said in unison, and they all laughed. Miss Rogers, the town librarian and a longtime Dahlia, always insisted on using the Latin names for plants. Two years before, she had taken cuttings from everyone&#x2019;s garden and propagated fourteen Confederate roses (not really roses, but hibiscus).- The young shrubs were now large and sturdy enough to be planted along the front fence at the Darling Cemetery. And since Confederate Day (an important Darling holiday, as it is across the South) was coming up shortly, it was time to get the plants settled in their new home. Summer would be along soon&#x2014;not a good time for transplanting.</p><p>Verna looked up at the sky and held out her hand, palm up. &#x201c;Was that a raindrop?&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy grabbed the rake from Ophelia. &#x201c;Come on, girls&#x2014;let&#x2019;s put the tools away and cool off with some iced tea. Maybe the storm will blow over before we&#x2019;re ready to head for home.&#x201d;</p><p>A few minutes later, the four Dahlias were sitting around the green-painted table in the clubhouse kitchen, a pitcher of mint-flavored tea and a plate of Dr. George Washington Carver&#x2019;s peanut cookies in front of them. The cookies had been baked by Roseanne, the cook at Magnolia Manor, Bessie Bloodworth&#x2019;s boardinghouse for &#x201c;genteel older ladies,&#x201d; next door to the Dahlias&#x2019; clubhouse.</p><p>&#x201c;That was good work this afternoon, ladies,&#x201d; Lizzy said, pouring the tea. She looked around the table, thinking how much she cherished these three friends. She enjoyed all the Dahlias&#x2014;like different varieties of roses, each one had her own particular beauty, while some had a few thorns. But the three sitting around the table with her this afternoon were very special.</p><p>&#x201c;That was <i>hard</i> work,&#x201d; Bessie said, pulling an embroidered hanky out of her sleeve and wiping her sweaty face with it. &#x201c;But as the saying goes, we can&#x2019;t plow a field by turning it over in our minds.&#x201d;</p><p>Gray-haired Bessie was twenty years older than the others, but she could work as long and as hard as any of the younger women in the club. She always said she&#x2019;d grown up with a hoe in her hand and okra and sunflower seeds in her pocket. Everybody valued her gardening experience, especially now that the Dahlias had decided to start raising vegetables in a big way.</p><p>Lizzy had been on the lookout for projects that would keep the club growing and working together, and the vegetable garden&#x2014;a natural, really&#x2014;had been her idea. The front yard of the clubhouse they had inherited from Dahlia Blackstone had once been filled with azaleas, roses, and hydrangeas, and behind the house had been almost an acre of beautiful flowers, sweeping down toward a clump of woods and a clear spring surrounded by bog iris, ferns, and pitcher plants. Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s garden had been so beautiful that it had been featured in newspapers as far away as New Orleans and Miami, and visitors from all over the state had come to Darling to see it.</p><p>But by the time the Dahlias took it over, the flowers and shrubs were disconsolate and abandoned and the garden looked as if it had completely given up hope. Determined to rescue it and restore its former beauty, the members had pulled on their gardening gloves and set to work. They repaired the trellises for the Confederate jasmine and mandevilla and cut back the exuberant cross vine and honeysuckle on the fence. They cleared the curving perennial borders so that the Shasta daisies, phlox, iris, asters, and larkspur could stretch out and bloom. They divided and replanted the Easter lilies, spider lilies, oxblood lilies, and Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s favorite orange ditch lilies. They also pruned Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s many roses&#x2014;the climbers, teas, ramblers, shrubs, and the unruly yellow Lady Banks, who had spread her sweeping skirts of green branches across the back corner. (&#x201c;Give a Lady Banks an inch and she&#x2019;ll take a mile,&#x201d; Earlynn Biddle always said.)</p><p>But when all that was done, Lizzy didn&#x2019;t let the ladies rest on their laurels. Next door to the clubhouse, on the corner, was a large vacant lot that had once been Mrs. Blackstone&#x2019;s vegetable garden&#x2014;the perfect place to grow vegetables. They had hired old Mr. Norris and his bay gelding, Racer, to plow the ground. Racer&#x2019;s name was sort of a joke, because he was as slow as molasses on a cold January morning. But once the old horse made up his mind to get to work, he was all business, and Mr. Norris pocketed a few dollars every spring by plowing and harrowing the town gardens.</p><p>After Racer had finished plowing and harrowing the ground, the Dahlias got started, raking the soil smooth and marking the rows for the corn, green beans, collards, Swiss chard, okra, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, squash, melons, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes they intended to plant. Lizzy had pointed out that the money they earned from the sale of their vegetables could go to fund other projects, such as the herb garden they were planning at the Retirement Haven, the old folks&#x2019; home out on Rayburn Road, and the new landscaping they hoped to put in around the courthouse.</p><p>With that incentive, all the Dahlias were eager to pitch in and help. All, that is, except for Voleen Johnson, wife of the town&#x2019;s banker. Mrs. Johnson didn&#x2019;t like to get dirt under her manicured fingernails. She did agree, however, to take money at the Saturday market, although she wore her fanciest hat and a pair of dainty white gloves to keep the dirty coins and bills from soiling her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Hard work and <i>hot</i> work,&#x201d; Ophelia put in cheerfully. &#x201c;Wonder if it&#x2019;s going to be like this all summer. I swear, it must have been ten degrees above normal all this week.&#x201d; She got up from the table and turned on the small electric fan, aiming the cooling breeze at the group at the table. &#x201c;If it gets any hotter, I&#x2019;m going to have to sit down at the Singer and run up a couple of cotton sundresses for Sarah. Mrs. Snow gave me some material for them.&#x201d; She gave her head a rueful shake. &#x201c;That girl is growing faster&#x2019;n a weed. Seems like I&#x2019;m always letting her hems down another inch.&#x201d;</p><p>Ophelia was one of the younger Dahlias. She and Jed Snow (the mayor of Darling and the owner of Snow&#x2019;s Farm Supply) had two children, Sam, a boisterous fourteen, and Sarah, just eleven but taller than her mother. A dedicated mother and a talented seamstress, Ophelia made their clothes instead of buying them at Mann&#x2019;s Mercantile, which saved quite a lot. She was also raising chickens so she could sell eggs at the Saturday market. Of course, Mrs. Hancock, at Hancock&#x2019;s Groceries, would buy the eggs, but Ophelia could earn more by selling them herself. Lizzy knew that every penny counted for the Snows right now, because business at the Farm Supply was falling off, and what trade there was, was mostly on credit. The farmers didn&#x2019;t have much cash money for seed and fertilizer and none at all for new equipment, which meant that it was lean times for the Snows&#x2014;and for all the merchants who depended on the farmers&#x2019; trade.</p><p>Verna Tidwell tilted her glass and drank. &#x201c;Normal,&#x201d; she muttered darkly, pouncing on Ophelia&#x2019;s word. &#x201c;These days, I wonder what normal is. I&#x2019;m not sure <i>anybody</i> knows. And I&#x2019;m not talking about the temperature, either.&#x201d;</p><p>Unlike Ophelia, who had a reputation for smiling through even the most calamitous events, Verna had a much darker view of human nature. She had a habit of peering &#x201c;under the rocks,&#x201d; as she put it, on the lookout for anything suspicious. Her prickly skepticism put some people off&#x2014;but not Lizzy, who admired her friend&#x2019;s sharp eyes and even sharper mind. Verna ably employed her talents as manager of the Cypress County probate clerk and treasurer&#x2019;s office, in the county courthouse. That&#x2019;s where she heard the whispers about who was doing this or that or the other bad thing and what was going to happen when word of these misdeeds got to the wrong (or the right) person.</p><p>And since Verna never expected to find anybody behaving any better than anybody else, she was never disappointed or distressed when she discovered that so-and-so had lied about his property boundaries or siphoned twenty gallons of fuel oil out of the tank behind the county road maintenance building or was operating a whiskey still over on Shiner&#x2019;s Knob.</p><p>&#x201c;Comes with the territory,&#x201d; she always said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want to smell folks&#x2019; dirty laundry, you should stay out of the probate clerk&#x2019;s office. That&#x2019;s where it all hangs out.&#x201d;</p><p>But in the past couple of weeks, Lizzy had noticed that Verna&#x2019;s expression was darker than usual, and more frowning. She was unusually silent, too, and there were fewer barbed remarks. Something was troubling Verna, and Lizzy could guess what it was. In the law firm of Moseley and Moseley where she worked, she often picked up bits of courthouse gossip. She&#x2019;d heard that there was some sort of trouble&#x2014;serious trouble&#x2014;with the county treasurer&#x2019;s accounts. But while Verna usually shared her personal life with Lizzy, she was always closemouthed about things that went on at the office. So Lizzy didn&#x2019;t ask what was going on. If Verna felt the need to talk, she&#x2019;d do it&#x2014;in her own sweet time.</p><p>Now, as if to endorse Verna&#x2019;s dark view of <i>normal</i>, there was a flash of lightning and an almost instantaneous clap of thunder so loud that it rattled the windows in the old house. All four of the Dahlias jumped.</p><p>&#x201c;Sakes alive,&#x201d; Bessie exclaimed. &#x201c;That one was too close for comfort. Wonder if it struck somewhere here in town.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;One year, I remember, the Free Will Baptist Church was struck by lightning. Burned right down to the ground while the preacher and his flock were having a baptizing in the river. When they got back, there was nothing left but ashes.&#x201d;</p><p>Lizzy chuckled. This was the kind of story that Bessie always came up with. She knew more local history than anybody.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be over soon,&#x201d; Ophelia reassured them. &#x201c;Give it fifteen minutes and the sun will be shining again. That&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>City Of Lost Souls</h2><p>Title: City of Lost Souls &lt;&gt;Binding: Hardcover &lt;&gt;Author: CassandraClare &lt;&gt;Publisher: MargaretK.McElderryBooks</p><p></p><h2>See a Grown Man Cry</h2><p>Book by Rollins, Henry Rollins</p><p></p><h2>The Great Crash, 1929</h2><p>A study of the stock market crash of 1929 that reveals the influential role of Wall Street on the economic growth of America</p><p>Rampant speculation. Record trading volumes. Assets bought not because of their value but because the buyer believes he can sell them for more in a day or two, or an hour or two. Welcome to the late 1920s. There are obvious and absolute parallels to the great bull market of the late 1990s, writes Galbraith in a new introduction dated 1997. Of course, Galbraith notes, every financial bubble since 1929 has been compared to the Great Crash, which is why this book has never been out of print since it became a bestseller in 1955.<p> Galbraith writes with great wit and erudition about the perilous actions of investors, and the curious inaction of the government. He notes that the problem wasn't a scarcity of securities to buy and sell; "the ingenuity and zeal with which companies were devised in which securities might be sold was as remarkable as anything." Those words become strikingly relevant in light of revenue-negative start-up companies coming into the market each week in the 1990s, along with fragmented pieces of established companies, like real estate and bottling plants. Of course, the 1920s were different from the 1990s. There was no safety net below citizens, no unemployment insurance or Social Security. And today we don't have the creepy investment trusts--in which shares of companies that held some stocks and bonds were sold for several times the assets' market value. But, boy, are the similarities spooky, particularly the prevailing trend at the time toward corporate mergers and industry consolidations--not to mention all the partially informed people who imagined themselves to be financial geniuses because the shares of stock they bought kept going up. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Previous ISBN 978-0-395-85999-5</p><h2>North Of The River: A Brief History of North Fort Worth (Chisholm Trail) (Volume 11)</h2><p>In 1848 the York and Gilmore families stopped their covered wagons north of the Trinity River near present-day Fort Worth.

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Rhannon Hills. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was <i>a</i> beginning.<br>Born among the groves and vineyards that covered much of the rugged hills, the olive trees in evergreen rows, the ordered vines leafless till spring, the cold wind blew west and north across the prosperous farms dotting the land between the hills and the great harbor of Ebou Dar. The land lay winter fallow still, but men and women were already oiling plowshares and tending harnesses, preparing for the planting to come. They paid little mind to the trains of heavily laden wagons moving east along the dirt roads carrying people who wore odd clothes and spoke with odd accents. Many of the strangers seemed to be farmers themselves, familiar implements lashed to their wagon boxes, and in their wagons unfamiliar saplings with roots balled in rough cloth, but they were heading on toward more distant land. Nothing to do with life here and now. The Seanchan hand lay lightly on those who did not contest Seanchan rule, and the farmers of the Rhannon Hills had seen no changes in their lives. For them, rain or the lack of it had always been the true ruler.<br>West and north the wind blew, across the broad blue-green expanse of the harbor, where hundreds of huge ships sat rocking at anchor on choppy swells, some bluff-bowed and rigged with ribbed sails, others long and sharp-prowed, with men laboring to match their sails and rigging to those of the wider vessels. Not nearly so many ships still floated there as had only a few days before, though. Many now lay in the shallows, charred wrecks heeled over on their sides, and burned frames settling in the deep gray mud like blackened skeletons. Smaller craft skittered about the harbor, slanting under triangular sails or crawling on oars like many-legged waterbugs, most carrying workers and supplies to the ships that still floated. Other small vessels and barges rode tethered to what appeared to be tree trunks shorn of branches, rising out of the blue-green water, and from those men dove holding stones to carry them down swiftly to sunken ships below, where they tied ropes to whatever could be hauled up for salvage. Six nights ago death had walked across the water here, the One Power killing men and women and ships in darkness split by silver lightnings and hurtling balls of fires. Now the rough rolling harbor, filled with furious activity, seemed at peace by comparison, the chop giving up spray to the wind that blew north and west across the mouth of the River Eldar, where it widened into the harbor, north and west and inland.<br>Sitting cross-legged atop a boulder covered with brown moss, on the reed-fringed bank of the river, Mat hunched his shoulders against the wind and cursed silently. There was no gold to be found here, no women or dancing, no fun. Plenty of discomfort, though. In short, it was the last sort of place he would choose, normally. The sun stood barely its own height above the horizon, the sky overhead was pale slate gray, and thick purple clouds moving in from the sea threatened rain. Winter hardly seemed winter without snow--he had yet to see a single flake in Ebou Dar--but a cold damp morning wind off the water could serve as well as snow to chill a man to the bone. Six nights since he had ridden out of the city in a storm, yet his throbbing hip seemed to think he was still soaked to the skin and clinging to a saddle. This was no weather or time of day for a man to be out by his own choice. He wished he had thought to bring a cloak. He wished he had stayed in bed.<br>Ripples in the land hid Ebou Dar, just over a mile to the south, and hid him from the city, as well, but there was not a tree or anything more than scrub brush in sight. Being in the open this way made him feel as though ants were crawling under his skin. He should be safe, though. His plain brown woolen coat and cap were nothing like the clothes he was known by in the city. Instead of black silk, a drab woolen scarf hid the scar around his neck, and the collar of his coat was turned up to hide that, as well. Not a bit of lace or a thread of embroidery. Dull enough for a farmer milking cows. No one he needed to avoid would know him to recognize if they saw him. Not unless they were close. Just the same, he tugged the cap a bit lower.<br>"You intend to stay out here much longer, Mat?" Noal's tattered dark blue coat had seen better days, but then so had he. Stooped and white-haired, the broken-nosed old fellow was squatting on his heels below the boulder, fishing off the riverbank with a bamboo pole. Most of his teeth were missing, and sometimes he felt at a gap with his tongue as though surprised to find the empty space. "It's cold, in case you haven't noticed. Everybody always thinks it's warm in Ebou Dar, but winter is cold everywhere, even places that make Ebou Dar feel like Shienar. My bones crave a fire. Or a blanket, anyway. A man can be snug with a blanket, if he's out of the wind. Are you going to do anything but stare downriver?"<br>When Mat only glanced at him, Noal shrugged and went back to peering at the tarred wooden float bobbing among the sparse reeds. Now and then he worked one gnarled hand as though his crooked fingers felt the chill particularly, but if so, it was his own fault. The old fool had gone wading in the shallows to scoop up minnows for bait with a basket that now sat half-submerged and anchored by a smooth stone at the edge of the water. Despite his complaints about the weather, Noal had come along to the river without urging or invitation. From things he had said, everyone he cared about was long years dead, and the truth of it was, he seemed almost desperate for any sort of company. Desperate, indeed, to choose Mat's company when he could be five days from Ebou Dar by now. A man could cover a lot of ground in five days if he had reason to and a good horse. Mat had thought on that very subject often enough himself.<br>On the far side of the Eldar, half-hidden by one of the marshy islands that dotted the river, a broad-beamed rowboat backed oars, and one of the crew stood up and fished in the reeds with a long boathook. Another oarsman helped him heave what he had caught into the boat. At this distance, it looked like a large sack. Mat winced and shifted his eyes downriver. They were still finding bodies, and he was responsible. The innocent died along with the guilty. And if you did nothing, then only the innocent died. Or as bad as died. Maybe worse than, depending on how you looked at it.<br>He scowled irritably. Blood and ashes, he was turning into a bloody philosopher! Taking responsibility drained all the joy out of life and dried a man to dust. What he wanted right then was a great deal of mulled wine in a snug common room full of music, and a plump, pretty serving maid on his knee, somewhere far from Ebou Dar. Very far. What he had were obligations he could not walk away from and a future he did not fancy. There seemed no help at all in being <i>ta'veren</i>, not if this was how the Pattern shaped itself to you. He still had his luck, anyway. At least, he was alive and not chained in a cell. Under the circumstances, that counted as luck.<br>From his perch, he had a fairly clear view down past the last low marshy river islands. Wind-caught spray drifted up the harbor like banks of fine mist, but not enough to hide what he needed to see. He was attempting to do sums in his head, counting ships afloat, trying to count wrecks. He kept losing his place, though, thinking he had counted vessels twice and starting over. The Sea Folk who had been recaptured intruded on his thoughts, too. He had heard that gibbets in the Rahad, across the harbor, displayed more than a hundred corpses, with placards listing "murder" and "rebellion" as their crimes. Normally, the Seanchan used the headsman's axe and the impaling stake, while the Blood got the strangling cord, but property had to settle for being hanged.<br><i>Burn me, I did what I could</i>, he thought sourly. There was no use feeling guilty that that was all he could do. Not a bit of use, None! He had to concentrate on the people who escaped.<br>The Atha'an Miere who got away had taken ships in the harbor for their flight, and while they might have seized some smaller craft, anything they could board and overwhelm in the night, they had intended to carry off as many of their people as possible. With thousands of them laboring as prisoners in the Rahad, that would have meant big ships, by choice, and that meant Seanchan greatships. Many of the Sea Folk's own vessels were large enough, for certain, but they all had been stripped of their sails and rigging by that time, to be fitted out in the Seanchan fashion. If he could calculate how many greatships remained, he might have some notion of how many Atha'an Miere had actually reached freedom. Freeing the Sea Folk Windfinders had been the right thing to do, the only thing he could do, but aside from the hangings, hundreds and hundreds of bodies had been fished out of the harbor in the last five days, and the Light only knew how many had washed out to sea with the tides. The gravediggers labored from sunup to sundown, and the graveyards were filled with weeping women and children. Men, too. More than a few of those dead had been Atha'an Miere, with no one to weep while they were dumped into mass graves, and he wanted some idea of the number he had saved to balance his bleak suspicions of the number he had killed.<br>Estimating how many ships had made it out into the Sea of Storms was difficult, though, quite apart from losing the count. Unlike Aes Sedai, Windfinders had no strictures against using the Power as a weapon, not when the safety of their people was at stake, and they would have...</p><h2>Pearls Falls Fast: A Pearls Before Swine Treasury (Volume 21)</h2><p>Enjoy a new treasury of <i>New York Times</i> Best-Selling <i>Pearls Before Swine</i>.<br><br> In this treasury collection of <i>Unsportsmanlike Conduct</i> and <i>Rat's Wars</i>, the eclectic <i>Pearls Before Swine</i> cast play out their respective roles.

It had been a draining weekend in the Lake District&#x2014;she'd played with her hosts'obstreperous children, gone on long hikes, eaten too much rich food, drank too much red wine, wrestled with her conscience and killed two men. All that without a cigarette. She was not in a good mood.<p>There was no question that the men had deserved to die. Manuel Kupersmith and Jorge Sullivan were the lowest of the low, and beyond the reach of traditional justice. Drug dealers with a taste for torture and a well-financed sympathy for terrorists, they'd covered their tracks too well. If she'd had to, she would have put a bullet in each of their dark, twisted brains.</p><p>As it was, she'd managed to sabotage their car, a nice, antiseptic kill. While she spent a social weekend with a member of parliament and his young family, it had been easy enough to wander past the inn where the two men had taken up residence, easy enough to sneak into the garage while the two were in bed. She knew a great deal about cars, and if her calculations were correct, the brakes would give out at the steep curve above the Lohan Cliffs and the car would end up on the rocks below. If the brakes failed too soon the car might hit a pedestrian; too late and they could run into the busy traffic of the neighboring town. Not something she'd be happy about, but a risk worth taking.</p><p>In the end, her timing had been perfect. As her hosts drove her to the train station in Lohan Downs they'd passed the police cars and the cordoned-off section of road, and her host had made important noises about road safety as Isobel breathed a silent sigh of relief. It was done.</p><p>She had the Sunday Times with her for the train ride back to London, and she finished the crossword puzzle in record time. Her flat in Bloomsbury was still and quiet as she let herself in, and she stripped off her clothes and headed straight for the shower, calm and impassive as always, ignoring her shaking hands.</p><p>She waited for the water to get hot, then stepped beneath it. And only then did she cry, silently, steadily. Not for the men. But for her own lost soul.</p><p>Peter Madsen looked up when Madame Lambert walked into the office the next morning, a cardboard cup of coffee in one hand, a newspaper under her arm. He had the same paper open in front of him.</p><p>"Shame about the car accident near the Lohan Cliffs," he said evenly, watching her out of the icy blue eyes that saw too much.</p><p>"Indeed," she said calmly. He would have been the one to do it, but he'd pulled back from that kind of work. Everyone reached their limit when it came to wet work&#x2014;either they burned out or made one too many mistakes. Peter was deskbound, not because of his bad leg but because he'd seen and done too much. His focus had changed to his American wife and the semblance of a normal life, and Isobel wasn't going to do anything to change that, even though she could.</p><p>But she was running out of people she could trust to do what was necessary and nothing more. In the three years since she'd taken over Harry Thomason's role as head of the Committee, she'd lost three effective operatives. Bastien had disappeared into the mountains of North Carolina with his wife and family, Peter was no longer on active duty, and Takashi O'Brien was dividing his time between Tokyo and Los Angeles. He could still be counted on to do what was necessary, but Isobel was not the kind of woman who made other people do things she herself wouldn't. And Taka had a new life as well&#x2014;he didn't need fresh blood on his hands.</p><p>Morrison in Germany, MacGowan in Central America were still working ops, and the Thai mission was almost complete. Takashi's young cousin, Hiromasa Shinoda, was due to arrive any day now, and if he was half as good as Taka they'd be in decent shape. Though the learning curve was steep, and Isobel knew nothing about young Mr. Shinoda except that Taka recommended him, which was good enough. But he wouldn't be ready for solo assignments for quite a while, and she didn't know who she could assign to train him.</p><p>She hated not knowing things. "You look rattled," Peter said, his voice cool and devoid of sympathy, as she needed it to be.</p><p>"I'm fine. It's just been awhile. Any sign of Taka's cousin?"</p><p>"Not yet. You had some calls."</p><p>There was something about the tone of his voice that twisted her stomach into a small knot of dread. She turned her impassive face back to him. "I imagine I did. Harry Thomason, I suppose?"</p><p>"Among others."</p><p>There were only the two of them in the Kensington offices of Spence-Pierce Financial Consultants, Ltd., their very effective cover. Anyone who managed to get through to them had every business doing so. More mundane matters were conducted at a distance.</p><p>Isobel took the leather club chair opposite Peter's desk, crossing her legs. Good legs for a woman in her sixties. Good legs for a woman in her forties. Not even bad for someone her real age.</p><p>"You may as well tell me." She pried the lid off the coffee and took a drink. "I've never known you to spare my tender feelings."</p><p>Peter laughed, a sound she was slowly getting used to. In the first ten years she'd known him she didn't think she'd ever heard him laugh. "Sensitivity was never my forte," he said. "Thomason wants to know what you're going to do about the situation with Serafin."</p><p>"Thomason can blow himself," Isobel said sweetly.</p><p>"Who have we got on him?"</p><p>"No one. Bastien did some of the preliminary work, as did I. But things stabilized and we had more important situations to deal with."</p><p>"Serafin," she said. "The Butcher." Her day had gone from bad to worse. "I thought he was just going to fade away like Qaddafi."</p><p>"No such luck. Only the good die young, and Josef Serafin doesn't fit that category."</p><p>She glanced longingly toward her office. She could go in there, close the door behind her and put her head down on the massive teak desk. Maybe bang it a few times for good measure. Peter was watching her, reading her mind. That was the problem with working with someone like Peter&#x2014;he was smart enough and intuitive enough to know what she was thinking at all times.</p><p>She wasn't going anywhere. "Fill me in," she said. "Tell me we're finally going to get to kill him. Please."</p><p>"I'm afraid not. We're going to have to save the son of a bitch's life."</p><p>"I hate this job," Isobel said, leaning back and closing her eyes for a moment. She gripped the coffee tightly. If her hand revealed even the faintest tremor, Peter would see it. "Details. Everything we know about Serafin, and why in God's name we have to keep him alive. Maybe I'll figure a way around it."</p><p>"I doubt it. He's got nine lives. Even Bastien wasn't able to take him down when he was ordered to."</p><p>"I forgot about that. Details," she said again, wearily.</p><p>"Josef Serafin, somewhere in his early forties. It's anybody's guess where he was born&#x2014;probably in a slum in Latin America. He first appeared on the scene in the late nineteen-eighties, part of an arms smuggling operation to the Congo. He branched out, became part of a drug cartel out of Colombia, just missing the big takedown in Cartagena, moved on and hired his services out as an assassin. He worked with the Shining Path in Peru, the Red Brigade in Italy, he'd worked in Croatia, Somalia, North Korea. Just about everywhere in the world where bad things happen. He's moved away from crime lords to politics, serving as second in command to three of the most ruthless dictators in recent history. He's managed to escape, unscathed, right before their governments came crashing down, and for the last five years he's been reported to be working in Africa, overseeing ethnic cleansing and political purging."</p><p>"Lovely man," Isobel murmured. "And we're supposed to save his life?"</p><p>Peter didn't bother to answer her question. "He's hiding out in Morocco for the time being, but we don't know how long that will last. He's got more enemies than bin Laden. Fouad Assawi was his most recent employer, but he was killed, part of the reason Serafin's on the run. Vladimir Busanovich is probably the biggest danger. He holds a grudge, and the last time Serafin worked for him he screwed up. Apparently something went wrong with the last round of executions, and at least three hundred of Busanovich's worst enemies escaped, right under Serafin's nose. Busanovich is not a tolerant man."</p><p>"And we're saving Serafin because...?"</p><p>"Because of the intel he brings with him. He knows just about all there is to know about the major players in the world of terrorism, and he's willing to trade that information for safe passage out of Morocco. That's where we come in."</p><p>She could always say no. She was the titular head of the Committee&#x2014;in the end her word was law. Orders were handed down by a shadowy group of old men, the actual "committee," and her nemesis and former boss, the newly knighted Harry Thomason, had joined their ranks. She'd like to blame this mess on Thomason, but then, his major drawback had been his readiness to eliminate anyone on the slightest pretext, and Josef Serafin should have been dealt with long ago. Thomason himself had ordered hits on Serafin half a dozen times, but no one, not even Bastien or Peter, had ever been able to get close to him.</p><p>Until now. Mistakes happened&#x2014;Serafin wouldn't be seeking asylum if he hadn't screwed up his deadly orders.</p><p>"So what's the plan?" she said, smoothing her perfect blond hair back from her face. "And don't tell me you don't have one&#x2014;I know you too well. Who are we going to send? We're shorthanded right now, and Genevieve would cut my throat if I tried to send you."</p><p>He flashed another of those rare, unexpected smiles that still managed to surprise her. "And then she'd cut mine. I thought of Taka, but he's still cleaning up the cult mess in Japan. Besides, we haven't been given a choice in the matter."</p><p>She raised an eyebrow, waiting for it. "They want you to go," he said. "In fact, it's a direct order. You're to get to Morocco, make contact with Serafin, extract him and bring him to London, where we can debrief him."</p><p>"And then?"</p><p>Peter shrugged. "He's got to h...</p></p><h2>God Bless the Gargoyles</h2><p>This moving story of misunderstood gargoyles and the gentle angels who console them will touch the heart of anyone who has ever felt alone and unloved.

My friendshipsseveral of thirty and forty years' duration--are the food and water that nourish my life. Once someone joins my intimate circle, I'm positively tenacious about keeping them in my loving grip.<br><br>Oh yes, I know what it means to have best friends. Let me tell you about Roz and Elaine.<br><br>"Ra Rut," as I used to call her, came into my life when I was three years old and her family moved into the identical row house directly across the street. One day she pushed me off my tricycle. I immediately forgave her. We've been best friends ever since. As children we talked about linking our houses with tin cans and string, but we never bothered because the only time we were apart was while we slept.<br><br>Our one and only major fight occurred when I lost the election for president of our high school sorority--and Roz won. I was utterly devastated that my best friend would oppose me. Friends aren't supposed to do that! But within a few days, something in my adolescent anguish realized that being friends with Roz mattered more to me than being angry with her. At some unspoken level, I think I recognized that if she wanted something as badly as I did, we both had the right to go for it. There had always been a subtle competition between us. Wherever one of us set the bar, the other strove to match the standard. But rather than creating friction, our rivalry stimulated our personal growth.<br><br>We are a living history of each other's lives. Fortunately, our interests and lifestyles have developed along similar lines. One reason our friendship has remained vibrant for so long is that we never outgrew each other. We have grieved together for the loss of parents, and celebrated every joyous occasion from our own fourth birthdays to the fourth birthdays of our grandchildren. Roz is not my family--but she might as well be.<br><br>The last thirty-something years of our friendship have included Elaine, who slipped in with us when she and Roz became neighbors in 1962. We leaned on each other as we muddled through child rearing, adjusted to the demands of marriage and tried to figure out what to do with our college-educated dreams. In the year we all turned fifty, Elaine was stricken with a brain tumor, which, thank God, turned out to be benign. Roz and I convinced the doctor to allow us into the recovery room when she came out of anesthesia. As we stood by her bed, placing ice chips in her mouth and mopping her brow with compresses, we recognized that we were as committed in our devotion to each other as any bride and groom reciting their marriage vows.<br><br>While we three don't have childhood memories in common, we have weathered the critical years of adulthood in an inextricable intimacy. No one knows my secrets like they do, and no one's advice has been more caring or valuable.<br><br>Because of them, my wonderful sister Patsy and a handful of others, I have come to learn that what matters in life is having best friends.<br><br>So it is no surprise that Sharon Wohlmuth and I chose to complete our trilogy on relationships by exploring friendship. As with our previous books, Sisters and Mothers and Daughters, we continue to be drawn to subjects that evoke our passion and draw deeply on our personal experience. Thus it was natural to turn to friendship, which is one of the strongest fibers in the lifeline that keeps us all afloat.<br><br>We included men this time because our books are as much about feelings as about people. And women do not own the friendship franchise, although the pivotal sisterhood of "girlfriends" certainly occupies a class by itself. Some psychologists have even suggested that the closeness of women friends is a reenactment of the instinctive mother-daughter bond.<br><br>Yet men are also capable of profound bonding, although in my interviews they often tended to describe their emotional attachment as "the kind of thing women have." Men assume that because women talk so easily to each other, they must reveal more about themselves. Not necessarily. Men can be as connected as women. They just behave differently. Men friends tend to meet around some kind of activity or common interest--like golf, tennis, bowling or business. Women friends tend to meet for lunch, using that activity as nothing more than an excuse for conversation.<br><br>But underneath, men and women share the exact same view of a best friend--the sense that this is a person who is always there for you. Someone you can depend on to share your happiness, suffer through your angst or cushion your sorrow. As one man put it, "To me a best friend is somebody that you call if you're on the expressway and get a flat tire at three A.M. and you've been told it's four hours until a tow truck can be sent. Your friend says,'Tell me exactly where you are and I'll come and get you.'"<br><br>A great variety of factors play into the birth of a best friendship--the age and circumstances under which people meet, what first attracts them, why they remain close, how they fill each other's needs. Yet I found the dominant themes that define a best friend were remarkably similar across the broadest range of experiences.<br><br>"Safety" was a word I heard over and over. A best friend is a safe harbor. A guaranteed comfort zone. You never have to explain yourself to a best friend because they really, really know who you are. With a best friend, you can drop your guard and let down your hair. You can cry too hard or laugh too loud and never worry what they'll think of you. Because best friends are nonjudgmental. They will supply you with feedback or advice if you want it and a kick in the pants if you need it, but a best friend will not stand in judgment or make you ashamed of your behavior. A best friend gives you what you expect from a parent and don't always get: z~nconditional loue.<br><br>Like Boy Scouts, best friends are loyal and trustworthy. A best friend is a love affair without sex, a twenty-four-hour intimacy hotline, a vessel where we can store our most embarrassing, revealing and damaging personal secrets with the full confidence they will never be repeated. Best friends can deliver brutally honest answers in the most gentle fashion. And best friends are a mun~al admiration society. What you see reflected in your best friend's eyes is the wonderful person you want to be.<br><br>Best friends are the family we choose--without the family baggage. They love us because they want to, not because they have to. And for many of us a best friend becomes the sibling we'd hoped for but never had, either because our parents never provided one or because the sister or brother we've been assigned doesn't live up to our expectations.<br><br>A man I knew asked his mother on her deathbed, "What has been the most important thing in your life?," fully expecting she'd say her husband, her children or her family. Instead, without a moment's hesitation, she replied sweetly, "My friends."<br><br>To everyone who receives our book from a friend, accept it as their tender message of love and appreciation. This gift tells you that, like me, you are blessed to know what it means to have best friends.<br><br>--Carol Saline<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1998<br>In the room in one's brain where memories are stored, I find it dif6CUlt to retrieve images of myself as a young child playing with a best friend.<br><br>Nor can I search and retrieve from boxes of old childhood photographs many images of myself smiling into the camera with my arms wrapped around a best friend. In most of the photographs I am with my relatives--cousins, aunts and uncles at our Sunday family gatherings.<br><br>Yet, there are dozens of pictures of my sister, Beth, and her best friend, Joanie, our neighbor--toothy three-year-olds embracing in Halloween costumes; and now, forty years later, still with their arms around each other at Beth's son's bar mitzvah. Their friendship over the years has become as well worn as the path that connected our backyards.<br><br>Why there are so few pictures of my own childhood friends doesn't really seem important to me now.<br><br>I realize as an adult that, unknowingly, my own journey to friendship began with a two-hundred-year-old oak tree that stood between my parents' and our neighbors' houses, dominating the landscape.<br><br>The oak provided the perfect "home" for the games of hideand-scek that we used to play. I loved the texture of its worn bark.<br><br>The massive trunk, too large for me to wrap my arms around, represented permanence and security.<br><br>My friends today remind me of that oak.<br><br>Now my arms reach all the way around, and my friends embrace me back. These friendships, full of love and affirmation, fortify my adult life, providing oxygen, color and texture. I look at my friends countless times every day, for photographs of them spill across my refrigerator door.<br><br>We explored a wide spectrum of relationships in Best Friends, as we did in our other two books, but in this one I found the same themes resonating throughout: trust, family, security, happiness, validation. Friendship is an elective bond, a relationship bound by connection and mutual admiration; and in many ways, it is all the more precious because something so powerful can spring from origins as elusive as a<br><br>chance meeting or a shared interest. In the course of creating this book, and getting to know the many wonderful people who participated in it, I have become all the more aware that friendship is a uniquely valuable bond, one that we all need and should treasure.<br><br>Ironically, though, the process of making this book took me away from my own friends for long periods of time. Now, as I write this, I look forward to sitting down over many cups of tea and catching up with those I cherish.<br><br>--Sharon J.

A collection of Greek and Roman myths arranged in sections on the gods and early heroes, love and adventure stories, the Trojan war, and a brief section on Norse mythology.</p><p>Edith Hamilton loved the ancient Western myths with a passion--and this classic compendium is her tribute. "The tales of Greek mythology do not throw any clear light upon what early mankind was like," Hamilton explains in her introduction. "They do throw an abundance of light upon what early Greeks were like--a matter, it would seem, of more importance to us, who are their descendents intellectually, artistically, and politically. Nothing we learn about them is alien to ourselves." Fans of Greek mythology will find all the great stories and characters here--Perseus, Hercules, and Odysseus--each discussed in generous detail by the voice of an impressively knowledgeable and engaging (with occasional lapses) narrator. This is also an excellent primer for middle- and high-school students who are studying ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>MONSTERS, MORTALS, GODS, AND WARRIORS<p>For over fifty years readers have chosen this book above all others to discover the thrilling, enchanting, and fascinating world of Western mythology. From Odysseus's adventure-filled journey to the Norse god Odin's effort to postpone the final day of doom, Edith Hamilton's classic collection not only retells these stories with brilliant clarity but shows us how the ancients saw their own place in the world and how their themes echo in our consciousness today. An essential part of every home library, MYTHOLOGY is the definitive volume for anyone who wants to know the key dramas, the primary characters, the triumphs, failures, fears, and hopes first narrated thousands of years ago -- and still spellbinding to this day.</p></p><h2>Penguin Classics Room With A View</h2><p>*Thoroughly edited. Does not contain the numerous typographical errors of other editions. &#34;Forster&#39;s innovation remains: he allowed the English comic novel the possibility of a spiritual and bodily life, not simply to exist as an exquisitely worked game of social ethics but as a messy human concoction. He expanded the comic novel&#39;s ethical space (while unbalancing its moral certainties) simply by letting more of life in . Austen asks for toleration from her readers. Forster demands something far stickier, more shameful: love.&#34; - Zadie Smith Also available in a Classroom Edition with Questions for Discussion (ISBN 978-1517773649).</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesA Room With a View portrays the love of a British woman for an expatriate living in Italy, a country which to Forster represents the forces of true passion. Caught up in a world of social snobbery, Forster's heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, finds herself constrained by the claustrophobic influence of her British guardians, who encourage her to take up with a well-connected boor. When she regrets that her hotel room has no view, a member of the lower class offers to trade rooms with her. Lucy becomes caught in a struggle between her own emotions and social conventions. In the end, however, Lucy takes control of her own fate and finds love with a man whose free spirit reminds her of a "room with a view".<p>There are some writers whose work is especially suitable for out-loud reading and E.M.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p><p>1<br>In the late afternoon of Octdi, Mykella dismounted at the base of the ramp leading to the north end of the Great Piers of Tempre. The top of the ramp ended some twenty yards short of the squarish one-story stone structure that held the portmaster and his clerks. Immediately to the north of the portmaster&#x2019;s building stood the shimmering green tower that dominated the northern end of the Great Piers of Tempre. <br>Behind Mykella, her younger and taller sister Rachylana also dismounted, if reluctantly, as did two of the four Southern Guards, in their uniforms of spotless dark blue, assigned to guard them, for none of the three daughters of the Lord- Protector of Lanachrona went anywhere outside the palace without an escort. <br>Mykella hurried up the ramp, and Rachylana followed, the two guards bringing up the rear. At the top of the ramp, Mykella slowed and glanced back at her sister. &#x201c;Do you want to come in?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why would I want to do that?&#x201d; <br>Instead of snapping that Rachylana might learn something, Mykella forced a smile. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not more than a glass, I&#x2019;d imagine. I&#x2019;ll wait out here.&#x201d; Rachylana walked farther west, her fl amelike mahogany hair barely kept in place by a dark maroon headband against the west wind coming off the water of the wide River Vedra. The wind was chill enough that the slightly acrid odor of the waters around the Great Piers was almost unnoticeable, and since the wind was directly from the west, it didn&#x2019;t pick up the far more odoriferous scents from the pens to the southwest where the towing oxen were kept when they were not hauling barges upstream or riding them downstream to begin the process all over again. <br>Two of the guards waited with Rachylana, as the other two followed Mykella. <br>The Great Piers were composed of the long base, an expanse of unchanging gray eternastone that stretched nearly a vingt from north to south along the east side of the river, and the more than fifteen stubby river wharves, eternastone fingers some thirty yards in length jutting out into the river. At the far south end of the Great Piers stood a second green tower, identical to the first, each soaring more than sixty yards into the silver-green sky. The towers were hollow shells, each with a single door at the base, but without stairs or any sign within that there had ever been any way to reach the top. Nor were there any windows or signs of any rooms in the tops of the towers, or in the others&#x2014;identical&#x2014;scattered across all of Corus. <br>More than half the piers had either sailing craft or barges moored to them. Carts and wagons were scattered across the short piers, some being loaded, but the majority being unloaded. Seemingly ignoring the chaos on the piers, Mykella walked briskly to the portmaster&#x2019;s door that faced the river and opened it. Two guards followed her step for step as she entered. <br>Inside, a squat white-haired man immediately rose and hurried to the long counter that separated the waiting area from the three clerks who appeared to be checking invoices for the purpose of levying the proper tariffs. One had only begun that process when he had seen Mykella, she noted. <br>&#x201c;Portmaster Chaenkel,&#x201d; Mykella said pleasantly. <br>&#x201c;Mistress Mykella, let me bring you the summary ledgers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; <br>At the left end of the counter, a grizzled bargemaster glanced toward Mykella and the pair of guards behind her, then looked quickly away and back at the clerk who stood waiting for him to finish declaring his cargo so that the form could be completed and the proper tariff levied&#x2014;after <br>inspection. <br>Chaenkel set the ledger before Mykella. <br>She began to study the entries for the week, of the sailing traders and the numbers of barges that had ported and departed, both those towed laboriously upstream, and those headed downstream with the current and guided by long sweeps. Most of those headed downstream were departing lighter than they had arrived, since, as the capital of Lanachrona, Tempre was generally a destination port, although wines from the Vyanhills and glassware from Krost were sought throughout the entire west of Corus, from frigid Northport to Southgate. <br>The total number of barges and other vessels was only three less than the total for the previous week, and the total of tariffs levied was close to the same. Mykella nodded and straightened. <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Portmaster. How do you think the trading and traffic have been?&#x201d; <br>Chaenkel furrowed his brow, then tilted his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be hard to say, Mistress. Not all that different from last week. It seems about the same as it should be for this time of year.&#x201d; He smiled, ruefully. &#x201c;When you get to be my age, the years blur, but I&#x2019;d know if things were greatly different.&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;That I would.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are we getting much trade from the east?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not any more than one would expect now that we&#x2019;re into winter. No less, either, from what I&#x2019;ve seen. A bit more iron from the Iron Valleys. Nightsilk&#x2014;who can say? That comes overland and under guard.&#x201d; <br>Mykella nodded to that. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My pleasure, Mistress.&#x201d; <br>Mykella turned. As she walked from the building, followed by the two Southern Guards, behind her Mykella heard the bargemaster. <br>&#x201c;... is she? Not seen her before...&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lord- Protector&#x2019;s eldest... checks on tariffs... since midsummer...&#x201d; <br>Had it been for less than two seasons? It seemed longer than that to Mykella. <br>Once back out on the Great Piers, Mykella continued to where Rachylana was standing. Just short of her sister, she paused to watch as a trading vessel eased out into the current and spread its sails, struggling upriver against the current. Was the trader bound for Borlan or farther east, perhaps to Salaan, the easternmost river port in Lanachrona before the Vedra became unnavigable? <br>&#x201c;What was it like, I wonder, when people could travel upstream without sails or oars?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Do you really believe those absurd tales about the Alectors? How could anyone?&#x201d; Rachylana sniffed. &#x201c;I mean... flying on creatures with wings as wide as sails, and on ships that had no sails or oars at all, and the River Vedra boiling over when it all came to an end in the Great Cataclysm. And soarers&#x2014;little winged women who floated in midair, yet destroyed giant Alectors. In hundreds of years, no one has ever found the remains of anything like that. Really, I could write a better story myself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perhaps you should,&#x201d; Mykella said blandly, knowing patience to write anything of length was hardly one of her sister&#x2019;s strengths. <br>&#x201c;Why bother? Anyone with any sense thinks they&#x2019;re just stories for children.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then who built the eternastone highways, and why are the old buildings built so large?&#x201d; asked Mykella. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve both seen chairs in the storerooms that are too large for the largest man to sit in them, and the steps in the palace are all too high to be comfortable climbing them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all nonsense,&#x201d; rejoined Rachylana. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just ceremonial chairs built for past Lords- Protector who wanted to seem larger, and the stairs are to make anyone who enters uncomfortable in the presence of the Lord- Protector.&#x201d; <br>Mykella refrained from pointing out that an overlarge throne or chair only made a large man seem smaller, and a man of average size seem insignificant. Rachylana wasn&#x2019;t about to listen to anything that reasonable. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re done, now, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Rachylana snapped, re-buttoning the top flap of her dark maroon jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m freezing. It is winter, you know?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Barely,&#x201d; replied Mykella. Octdi was the eighth day of the week, the last full working day before the end-days of Novdi and Decdi, and this particular Octdi was the second of the winter. Besides, Tempre never got as cold as the Iron Valleys did, the forbidding lands that stretched northward from the far side of the Vedra, reaching almost to the Ice Sands that bordered the Aerlal Plateau. <br>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see why you need to come here every Octdi&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m checking with the portmaster to see how many traders ported this week, compared to the week before. The tariff ledgers in the palace just show the totals collected. It&#x2019;s not the same.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why you spend so much time checking on river traders and talking to people like the portmaster... or those bargemasters.&#x201d; Rachylana offered her most serious frown. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the Lord- Protector&#x2019;s daughter, not a clerk like Kiedryn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If Father&#x2019;s brother can be Finance Minister, I can certainly supervise the accounting,&#x201d; Mykella replied. In any instance, doing that was far less boring than speculating about which son of which ruler in what adjoining land might decide to make an offer for her hand. Mykella preferred to avoid thinking about that eventuality at all. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hardly supervising. Father&#x2019;s just letting you do it so that...&#x201d; Rachylana&#x2019;s voice trailed off. <br>&#x201c;So that what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So that you&#x2019;ll know more about accounts when you get consorted, I suppose.&#x201d; <br>Mykella knew very well that what Rachylana had said was not what she&#x2019;d started to say, but let it pass. <br>&#x201c;Can we go now that you&#x2019;re done with whatever it was?&#x201d; added Rachylana. <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to come,&#x201d; Mykella pointed out. &#x201c;Or did you think that Berenyt might want to escort us?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought it might be more interesting than helping Nealia or Auralya plan the dinner menus for next week.&#x201d; Rachylana&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>The Sound of Wings: The Life of Amelia Earhart</h2><p>A revealing profile depicts Earhart&#39;s tomboy childhood in Kansas, her close relationship with her alcoholic father, and her meeting and subsequent married life with publisher G.P. Putnam</p><p><p>Mary S. Lovell is author of the international bestselling biography <i>Straight on Till Morning: The Biography of Beryl Markham </i>and other acclaimed biographies on Sir Richard Burton, Jane Digby, the Mitford Girls, Betty &#x201c;Cynthia Pack&#x201d;, and Bess of Hardwick. She lives in Hampshire, England.</p>Both of these new biographies on Earhart are exceedingly well-researched and clearly written. Although they have the same biographical intent, they differ in their approach. Rich emphasizes Earhart's flying career and the stories and personalities behind her accomplishments. Hers is a scholarly account of Earhart's life, highlighting her goals, enthusiasm, and competitive pioneer spirit. Lovell, also author of Straight on Till Morning: The Biography of Beryl Markham ( LJ 9/15/87), delves more into the personalities of Earhart and George Palmer Putnam, her media-wise husband. Earhart's personality and character and the relationships with family and friends as they contributed to her accomplishments are the main thrust. The book also contains excerpts from Last Flight , Earhart's reworked logbook and notes on the fateful 1937 flight. Both books detail her life and the theories of her disappearance. They also clearly address Earhart's legacy: to dream what seems to be unattainable goals and then to acquire the skills and have the desire and determination to achieve them. Also, while Earhart is known today for her flying career and her mysterious disappearance, these books show her to be an early advocate of women's rights, equality, and world peace, who used her fame to help promote them. Both books are highly recommended; Lovell's book will appeal more to general readers. Lovell's book is a Literary Guild selection and Doubleday Book Club alternate.<br><i>- Ed. --William A.

Tour.</p><p>Just as <i>Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> used motorcycle repair as a metaphor for the examination of self, Howell Raines uses his lifelong experiences as a fly fisherman to explore his life, politics, gender, roles as a son, husband, father, and journalist, and his attitudes toward aging and mortality. A man who has fished with presidents and Southern friends as well as with his own two sons, Raines chronicles his progress from "the Redneck way of fishing" for quantity and food to the catch-and-release way of his friend and mentor Dick Blalock. Blalock taught Raines that fly fishing is about attitude and friendship, not about catching fish. Raines imparts tips on casting and stream beds gracefully, along with his love for what he calls "waters that move" as he explores the deep funk he fell into at midlife, complete with a divorce, a seven-year feud with his father and brother, and the all-consuming animosity he allowed himself to develop toward his boss at work. By casting into the waters of his own life -- and ultimately reconciling with middle age -- Howell Raines has written a literate, contemplative celebration of life and friendship. "Intriguing and textured.... the book of a highly intelligent man.... He limns the great appeal of fly fishing as well as anyone has done." -- Nick Lyons, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>."Intriguing and textured.... the book of a highly intelligent man....

Her portraits of markets from Maine to Hawaii showcase the bounty of America&#x2019;s family farms and reveal the sheer pleasure to be found in shopping for and cooking with local foods.<br><br>Deborah Madison follows the seasons in her cross-country journey, beginning with the first tender greens of spring and ending with those foods that keep. Recipes such as Chard and Cilantro Soup with Noodle Nests and Lamb&#x2019;s-Quarters with Sonoma Teleme Cheese launch the market season, followed by such dishes as an Elixir of Fresh Peas or a Radish Sandwich. Recipes for Whole Little Cauliflowers with Crispy Breadcrumbs and White Beans with Black Kale and Savoy Cabbage illustrate the range of the robust crucifers, while herbs and alliums provide the inspiration for a lively Herb Salad, tisanes, and Sweet and Sour Onions with Dried Pluots and Rosemary. <br>Deborah Madison challenges the conventional view of what&#x2019;s seasonal. A Young Root Vegetable Braise celebrates that early crop of delicate roots, while Braised Root Vegetables with Black Lentils and Red Wine Sauce offers an elegant centerpiece dish for the heartier roots of winter. <br><br>Superlative fresh eggs, along with handmade cheese, are featured players at the markets everywhere, and here they appear in such simple dishes as Fried Eggs with Sizzling Vinegar and Warm Ricotta Custard featuring fresh whole-milk ricotta. Because organically raised poultry and meats have an increasingly important presence in our farmers&#x2019; markets, they are included, too, paired with other market produce that highlights their flavors, as in Roast Chicken with Herbs Under the Skin. <br><br>Late summer corn and beans inspire Corn Fritters with Aged Cheddar and Arugula and Shelly Beans with Pasta and Sage. When markets are filled with squashes and melons, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, Deborah Madison shows us that they&#x2019;re perfect ingredients for simple, vibrant dishes, such as Braised Farmers&#x2019; Long Eggplant Stuffed with Garlic or Tropical Melon Soup with Coconut Milk. For the happily overwhelmed cook, Platter Salads suggest how to go ahead and use <i>all</i> of the market&#x2019;s bounty.<br><br>Fruits, another vital part of farmers&#x2019; markets, are generously featured. Huckleberries, unusual grapes, and figs; stone fruits like plums and peaches; heirloom apples, persimmons; winter citrus and subtropical fruits are all here. Fig Tart with Orange Flower Custard; Peach Shortcake on Ginger Biscuits; a Rustic Tart of Quinces, Apples, and Pears; and a Passion Fruit and Pineapple Compote are just a few of the luscious desserts. And, because the market features more than fresh foods of the moment, recipes based on dried fruits, oils, vinegars, preserves, and other long-keeping foods help the reader continue eating locally once the market season has ended.<br><br>By going behind the scenes to speak with the farmers and producers, Deborah Madison connects readers directly with the people who grow their food. Full-color photographs of gorgeous produce, mouthwatering dishes, and evocative scenes from the markets will entice every reader to cook from the farmers&#x2019; market as often as possible.</p><p>In her previous cookbooks <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> and the classic <i>Greens Cookbook</i>, among others, Deborah Madison scored with savory yet sophisticated fare--the kind of food even meat lovers relish. <i>Local Flavors: Cooking and Eating from America's Farmers' Markets</i> finds Madison shopping those havens of quality, taste, and diversity, and devising recipes based on their seasonally available bounty. Among the 350 recipes--not all vegetarian--fans will immediately recognize the Madison hand in dishes like Soft Tacos with Roasted Green Chiles, Spinach and Green Garlic Souffl�, and Winter Squash "Pancake" with Mozzarella and Sage. There's more to the book, however: "Many people still think that the farmers' market is the place you go to for cheap food," says Madison. More to the point, they're a source for "truly local and therefore truly seasonal [food], quite likely raised by sound sustainable methods and by someone who might become your friend." It's a message most readers will embrace.<p> The book offers chapters deftly arranged by fruit and vegetable families as they appear in the markets, such as "The Vegetable Fruits of Summer: Eggplants, Tomatoes, and Peppers" and "A Cool Weather Miscellany," which includes recipes such as Saut�ed Artichokes with Potatoes and Garlic Chives and a marvelous "essence-of" soup, Elixir of Fresh Peas.

Now she has expanded it into a memoir of her journey through the last century as confidant, collaborator, and muse to some of its most inspired minds and personalities: a diverse assemblage that ranges from the fathers of dada and surrealism to Virgil Thompson, George Balanchine, Alberto Giacometti, Dylan Thomas, Truman Capote, Joan Mir�, James Merrill, and many more. At its center is the relationship, tenderly rendered, between Tanning and her famed husband, the enigmatic surrealist Max Ernst.<br><br> Whether recalling the poignant presence of her friend Joseph Cornell or simply marveling at the facades along a Venice canal, "their filmy reflections fluttering in the dirty canal like fragile altar cloths hung out to dry," Tanning's writing is beguiling, wry, and shot through with the same eye for pregnant detail and immanent magic that marks her art.</p><p>Dorothea Tanning&#39;s painting and sculpture rank among the most inventive of any living American artist. Her poetry has appeared in The New Republic, Partisan Review, and The Paris Review, among many other publications, and was included in The Best American Poetry 2000. She lives in New York City.A noted American artist born in Galesburg, Ill., Tanning lived in a milieu of European creativity as wife of the surrealist painter Max Ernst (1888-1976). Now in her 90s, she has expanded a previous memoir (Birthdays) to offer a fuller reminiscence. She is self-effacing, finding Ernst's life and story more interesting than her own, but describes their shared life poetically: "Yes, I think I was his house. He lived in me, he decorated me, he watched over me." While there are glimpses of other creative talents, like the composer-critic Virgil Thomson, who snoozed next to Tanning while supposedly reviewing a concert, Tanning is best on artists, like the oddball genius Joseph Cornell: " a modern Dante, with his deep religious feeling and physical abstinence. Consummate romantic in an intoxicatingly worldly world, he came frequently to town as from some remote monastic commune." Fans of name-dropping will melt at her wedding with Ernst, a double marriage with Mr. and Mrs. Man Ray, with Stravinsky offering the wedding toast. More noteworthy is Tanning's ready wit, as in the story of a French neighbor's cat who would wait till his master arrived home, then "jumps up on the table and urinates in his soup." Surviving the devastating loss of Ernst, she concludes: "By evening the pall has lifted. Everything waits, radiant. Life is okay." Few surrealists or those close to them would have such a sunny world view, but this vigorous optimism is part of Tanning's real charm, not to mention her ever-improving art and poetry, both of which arrived at a new level of achievement when she was already a senior citizen. Modern art lovers of multiple generations will want this book, as will universities with larger art history collections. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Opening Wednesday at a Theater Or Drive-In Near You: The Shadow Cinema of the American &#39;70s</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Movie criticism's Dostoyevsky . . . Taylor reveals a national identity forged from the innocence we claim to have lost but never had in the first place.&#x201d; --Steve Erickson, author of <i>Zeroville</i></b></p><p>When we think of '70s cinema, we think of classics like <i>The</i> <i>Godfather</i>, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and <i>The Wild Bunch</i> . . . but the riches found in the overlooked B movies of the time, rolled out wherever they might find an audience, unexpectedly tell an eye-opening story about post-Watergate, post-Vietnam America. Revisiting the films that don't make the Academy Award montages, Charles Taylor finds a treasury many of us have forgotten, movies that in fact "unlock the secrets of the times."</p><p> Celebrated film critic Taylor pays homage to the trucker vigilantes, meat magnate pimps, blaxploitation "angel avengers," and taciturn factory workers of grungy, unartful B films such as <i>Prime Cut</i>, <i>Foxy Brown</i>, and <i>Eyes of Laura Mars</i>. He creates a compelling argument for what matters in moviemaking and brings a pivotal American era vividly to life in all its gritty, melancholy complexity.</p></p><p><b>Charles Taylor</b> has written on movies, books, popular culture, and politics for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Salon</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Newsday</i>, <i>Dissent</i>, the<i> Nation</i>, the <i>New York Observer</i>, <i>Lapham's Quarterly</i>, and others. A member of the National Society of Film Critics, Taylor has contributed to several of the society's volumes, and his work appears in <i>Best Music Writing 2009</i>. He has taught journalism and literature courses at the New School, the Columbia School of Journalism, and the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at NYU. Taylor lives in New York.<p>"Brilliant . . . a vivid and expansive cultural history . . . Taylor never loses sight of (much less condescends to) these movies' gritty, visceral pleasures, but he also calls attention to their largeness of spirit, the glimmers of tenderness and melancholy they managed to conceal within their seemingly routine genre frameworks . . . superbly argued." - <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Taylor, a film-crit veteran, can neatly evoke a visual . . . You can tell when someone's writing about what they love, and whether it's the empty sky of <i>Vanishing Point</i> or the neurosis of <i>Eyes of Laura Mars</i>, Taylor's having a blast. Tying a dozen movie underdogs to a wider cultural history is just the icing on the cake. You might not love them the same way he does (he might prefer it that way), but <i>Opening Wednesday</i> might just get you to watch." - <i>NPR.org</i></p><p>"Provocative and engaging . . . Taylor invests his study with a breadth and scope admirable for its ambition . . . A fiercely argued encomium for the socio-historical virtues of the great '70s B movies, in all their messy beauty . . . [Taylor is] engrossing and persuasive, pulling off the rare feat of turning cinema into works of cultural anthropology without losing his reader . . . He's mastered the art of film criticism as historical analysis, using these movies as a way in to the study of an America that no longer exists--and, using his movies to tee off against other, more reductive films, the idea that maybe a happier one never really did." - <i>The A.V. Club</i></p><p>"An astute critic of film and popular culture in general, Taylor is often drawn to the grittier vitality of the dark underbelly. This collection of critical essays will provide revelation for many&#x2015;readers who have never heard of most of these movies&#x2015;but it also serves as vindication for the movie geeks who know exactly where Quentin Tarantino finds inspiration. . . . He makes readers eager to see movies that were barely seen the first time through. An illuminating collection of film criticism." - Starred Review, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Film and culture critic Taylor opines that many worthy 1970s movies (or at least those worthy of reconsideration) have been unfairly overlooked . . . . For each, he talks about the plot, cultural underpinnings, and sometimes troubled production histories . . . . Taylor makes a very reasonable case for reexamining each one, assisted by a most readable writing style." - <i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Film critic Taylor's first collection brings together a wondrous set of essays on 1970s American B-movies. The decade is known for classics such as <i>The Godfather </i>and <i>Taxi Driver</i>, but Taylor has chosen to highlight the pleasures of lesser-known films. . . . His essays are consistently illuminating and the reader comes away with a strong desire to track down the films he praises." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"An interesting and frequently surprising look at a vibrant era in American film history." - <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Charles Taylor's first collection of film essays exudes energy, persuasiveness and a deep knowledge and love for movies and pop culture. He writes with a passion and unbridled enthusiasm that rivals Pauline Kael . . . <i>Opening Wednesday </i>is an intelligent, opinionated and fascinating introduction to some great lower-profile 1970s films. Film buffs will find Taylor's guide illuminating and indispensable." - <i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>[Taylor] is an excellent writer with a broad knowledge of cinema and this is an important book. <i>- LeonardMaltin.com</i></p><p>"Hugely entertaining and wise . . . [An] honest and brilliant critic rearranging what people ought to know about movies in an era when machines do most of the knowing." - <i>The Buffalo News, Editor's Choice</i></p><p>"Film critic Taylor revisits the B movies of the 1970s and makes a passionate case for their 'grungy, visceral appeal.' Among his favorites: the blaxploitation flicks <i>Foxy Brown</i> and <i>Coffy</i> with Pam Grier, Sam Peckinpah&#x2019;s critical bomb <i>Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</i> and the 'sleazy urban chic' of <i>Eyes of Laura Mars</i> with Faye Dunaway." - <i>Newsday</i></p><p>"A loving look at some forgotten gems and the power of moviemaking that can often be ignored." - <i>IndieWire</i></p><p>"Taylor may be at his best when he looks at those '70s movies that don't fit into any easily defined genre . . . [He] has a singular voice, and that's part of the fun." - <i>Newark Star-Ledger</i></p><p>"An influential and compulsively readable film critic . . . He called it like he saw it, often employing the sorts of provocative turns of phrase that spark arguments in parking lots . . . Such vivid commentary affords readers a pathway into movies." - <i>Slant Magazine</i></p><p>"A beautifully-crafted, loving, angry and perceptive collection of film criticism." - <i>A Classic Movie Blog</i></p><p>"Taylor's writing is sharp and insightful, funny and thought-provoking, and in his book he shines a spotlight on 15 films that--in their own 'disreputable' ways--speak deeply about the era in which they were made." - <i>RogerEbert.com</i></p><p>"With <i>Opening Wednesday</i>, film critic Charles Taylor has written a glorious appreciation of the B-movies of the 1970s. This makes for a cinephile must-read." - <i>The Film Stage</i></p><p>"Movie criticism&#x2019;s Dostoyevsky, Charles Taylor scribbles notes from the underground of suburban basements in the Seventies, when Americans could barely tell anymore the subversive from the square. In forgotten semi-classics like <i>Cisco Pike</i> and cult stars like Lee Marvin (&#x2018;an almost subterranean actor&#x2019;), charting heretofore unseen connections between Faye Dunaway and Mick Jagger, Taylor reveals a national identity forged from the innocence we claim to have lost but never had in the first place." - Steve Erickson, author of TOURS OF THE BLACK CLOCK, ZEROVILLE, and SHADOWBAHN</p><p>"Charles Taylor's impassioned exploration of the underside of '70s cinema is blunt about the flaws of these films but utterly persuasive about their value. This is provocative, informed, richly contextualized cultural criticism for readers to revel in, learn from, laugh with, and argue about." - Mark Harris, author of PICTURES AT A REVOLUTION and FIVE CAME BACK</p><p>"Reading Charles Taylor&#x2019;s <i>Opening Wednesday</i> is like looking in a mirror--in this case the mirror of such officially celebrated 1970s movies as <i>The Godfather </i>and <i>Mean Streets</i>. You see yourself in unfamiliar but dimly recognizable clothes that, you swear, aren&#x2019;t your own: slept in, utilitarian, garish, tasteless, and yet somehow beckoning, like a repressed memory. As you pass through this book, whether <b>you know</b> the movies Taylor dives into or not, you&#x2019;ll find that the book casts its own shadows: you have to see these pictures, right now." - Greil Marcus</p></p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s Great Big Mystery Book</h2><p>Detectives Sam Cat and Dudley Pig set out to catch a grocery store thief and a pie burglar</p><p>Born in Boston in 1919, Richard Scarry&#39;s drawing talent led him to study at the Boston Museum School.

I love looking at the skeins of yarn in all their colors and feeling the different textures. I love my knitting classes and the friends I've made here. I love studying the pattern books. I love gazing out my front window onto the energy and activity of downtown Seattle. In fact, I love <i>everything </i>about this life I've found, this world I've built.</p><p> </p><p>Knitting was my salvation. That's something I've said often, I know, but it's simply the truth. Even now, after nearly ten years of living cancer-free, knitting dominates my life. Because of my yarn store, I've become part of a community of knitters and friends.</p><p> </p><p>I'm also married now, to Brad Goetz. A Good Yarn was my first real chance at life and Brad was my first chance at love. Together, Brad and I are raising our nine-year-old son. I say Cody's <i>our</i> son, and he is, in all the ways that matter. I consider him as much my child as Brad's; I couldn't love Cody more if I'd given birth to him. It's true he has a mother, and I know Janice does care about him. But Brad's ex-wife is!well, I hesitate to say it, but <i>selfish</i> is the word that inevitably comes to mind. Janice appears intermittently in Cody's life, whenever the mood strikes her or she happens to find it convenient&#x2014;despite the parenting plan she signed when she and Brad divorced. Sadly, she only sees her son once or twice a year. I can tell that the lack of communication bothers Cody. And Janice's cavalier attitude toward motherhood angers me, but like my son, I don't mention the hurt. Cody doesn't need me to defend or malign Janice; he's capable of forming his own opinions. For a kid, he's remarkably resilient and insightful.</p><p> </p><p>On a February morning, my store with all its warmth and color was a cozy place to be. The timer on the microwave went off; I removed the boiling water and poured it into my teapot after dropping in a couple of tea bags. The rain was falling from brooding, gray skies as it often does in winter. I decided it was time to start another knitting class. I maintain several ongoing classes and charity knitting groups, and I usually begin a new session four or five times a year.</p><p> </p><p>As I considered my new class, I was also thinking about my mother, who's adjusted to life in the assisted-living complex reasonably well. In some ways, I suspect that moving her was even more difficult for my sister, Margaret, and me than it was for Mom. Although Mom hated giving up her independence, she seemed relieved not to have the worry about the house and yard anymore. I wept the day the house was sold, and while she never allowed me to see her tears, I believe Margaret did, too. Selling the house meant letting go of our childhood and all the reminders of growing up there. It was the end of an era for us both, just as it was for our mother.</p><p> </p><p>While I drank my tea, I f lipped through the new patterns that had arrived the day before. The first one to catch my eye was a prayer shawl. Lately, I'd seen several patterns for these shawls, some more complex than others. I could easily envision knitting this one for Mom. </p><p> </p><p>Prayer shawls have become popular in the last few years&#x2014;and not only for prayer. They offer comfort and warmth, emotional, as well as physical. I'd received several inquiries about them and thought perhaps one of these shawls would make for an interesting class. I decided to discuss it with my sister, Margaret, who has a keen business sense and a good feel for which class I should offer next. I didn't appreciate that about her until after she'd come to join me at the shop. Margaret worked for me part-time, which has now turned into full-time. She's not as good with people as I am, but she knows yarn and, surprisingly, has become an excellent employee. She's also my friend. Not so long ago, I couldn't have said that; we might be sisters, but the tension between us was unbearable at times. Our relationship changed for the better, and I thank A Good Yarn for that.</p><p> </p><p>Margaret wouldn't arrive for another thirty minutes, since the shop officially opened at ten. Any number of tasks awaited my attention, things I should be doing, like paying bills and ordering new yarn. Instead, I sat at my desk, with my teacup between my hands. I felt so incredibly blessed.</p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, I didn't always feel this tranquil. When I was in my early twenties, a second bout of cancer struck with a viciousness that had me reeling. I survived, but my father didn't. You see, he fought so hard for me, and when it seemed I'd make it after all, he died, suddenly and unexpectedly, of a heart attack. It was almost as though my recovery meant he could leave me now. </p><p> </p><p>Before I lost Dad, I tended to approach my life tentatively, afraid of happiness, fearing the future. It was a void that loomed hopelessly before me and filled me with dread. Dad was the one who gave me strength. With him gone, I knew I was responsible for my own life. I had a decision to make and I boldly chose!independence. I chose to become part of the world I'd retreated from years before.</p><p> </p><p>The ceiling above me creaked and I knew Colette was up. Colette Blake rented the small apartment over the shop. For the first two years, that tiny apartment was my home, my very first home away from family.</p><p> </p><p>After I married Brad, I wasn't quite sure what to do with the apartment. It stood empty for a while. Then I met Colette, and I'd known instantly that she'd be the perfect tenant. The apartment would console her, give her a place to regain her emotional balance. A bonus&#x2014;for me&#x2014;is that she looks after Whiskers on my days off. My cat is a much-loved feature in my store, which he considers his home. I've had customers stop by just to visit him. He often sleeps in the front window, curling up in the afternoon sun. Whiskers generates lots of comments&#x2014;and smiles. Pets have a way of connecting people to life's uncomplicated joys.</p><p> </p><p>Colette reminds me of myself three years ago, when I first opened the store. I met her shortly before Christmas, when Susannah Nelson, who owns the f lower shop next door, brought her over to meet me. It wasn't cancer that shook her world, though. It was death. Colette is a thirty-one-year-old widow. Her husband, Derek, a Seattle policeman, died a little over a year ago. When I mention that, people usually assume Derek was killed in the line of duty. Not so. Following a Seattle downpour, he climbed on the roof to repair a leak. No one knows exactly how it happened but apparently Derek slipped and fell. He died two days later of massive head injuries.</p><p> </p><p>In the weeks since she'd moved here, Colette had only referred to the accident once, as if even talking about her husband was difficult. I've learned that she's an easygoing person who laughs readily and yet at times her grief seemed palpable. Overwhelming. I understood how she felt. I remembered all too well that sense of anguish, that terror of what might happen tomorrow or the next day. Colette approached life fearfully, just the way I once did. I longed to reassure her, and I hoped my friendship provided some pleasure and solace. Friends like Jacqueline and Alix had done the same for me.</p><p> </p><p>The apartment has an outside entrance, as well as the one leading into the store. Susannah Nelson had hired Colette soon after Susannah purchased what used to be known as Fanny's Floral. Colette's mother once owned a f lower shop, and Colette had worked there as a high-school student. Her house sold practically the day it was listed, and Colette needed to move quickly. My tiny apartment was vacant, so we struck a deal. I assumed she wouldn't be there long. Most of her belongings were in storage and she was taking the next few months to decide where she'd live and what she'd do.</p><p> </p><p>The stairs creaked as she ventured down. Since Colette became my tenant, we sometimes shared a pot of tea in the mornings. She was always respectful of my time and I enjoyed our leisurely chats.</p><p> </p><p>"Tea's ready." I reached for a clean cup. Without asking, I filled it and held it out.</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks." Colette smiled as she took the tea.</p><p> </p><p>She was thin&#x2014;too thin, really. Her clothes were a bit loose, but with her aptitude for style she cleverly disguised it. I noticed, though, as someone who's done the same thing. Part of what I liked about her was the fact that she was lovely without seeming consciously aware of it. Despite her occasional silences, Colette was warm and personable, and I could see she'd be a success at whatever she chose. She hadn't said much about the job she'd left, but I gathered it was a far more demanding position than helping customers in a f lower shop.</p><p> </p><p>This job change obviously had something to do with her husband's death. She told me he'd died a year ago January fourteenth. She'd waited for the year to pass before making major changes in her life&#x2014;selling her home, moving, quitting her job. These changes seem drastic in some ways and completely understandable in others.</p><p> </p><p>Colette wore her long, dark hair parted in the middle. It fell straight to her shoulders, where it curved under. She seemed to achieve this effect naturally&#x2014;unlike some women, who spend hours taming their hair with gel and spray.</p><p> </p><p>In the short time she'd been here, Colette had made a positive impression on everyone she met. Everyone except my sister. Margaret, being Margaret, shied away from Colette, instinctively distrusting her. My sister's like that; she tends to be a naysayer. She...</p></p><h2>Reach for the Sky : Story of Douglas Bader, D.S.O., D.F.C.</h2><p>In 1931, at the age of 21, Douglas Bader was the golden boy of the RAF. Excelling in everything he did he represented the Royal Air Force in aerobatics displays, played rugby for Harlequins, and was tipped to be the next England fly half. But one afternoon in December all his ambitions came to an abrupt end when he crashed his plane doing a particularly difficult and illegal aerobatic trick. His injuries were so bad that surgeons were forced to amputate both his legs to save his life. Douglas Bader did not fly again until the outbreak of the Second World War, when his undoubted skill in the air was enough to convince a desperate air force to give him his own squadron. The rest of his story is the stuff of legend. Flying Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain he led his squadron to kill after kill, keeping them all going with his unstoppable banter. Shot down in occupied France, his German captors had to confiscate his tin legs in order to stop him trying to escape. Bader faced it all, disability, leadership and capture, with the same charm, charisma and determination that was an inspiration to all around him.</p><p>During the war Paul Brickhill was shot down over German territory and sent to a prisoner of war camp. After the war he wrote about the numerous escape attempts in which he was involved in THE GREAT ESCAPE. REACH FOR THE SKY, and THE DAMBUSTERS RAID are his most famous works.</p><h2>Introduction to Permaculture</h2><p>The word &#34;permaculture&#34; was coined and popularized in the mid 70&#39;s by David Holmgren, a young Australian ecologist, and his associate / professor, Bill Mollison. It is a contraction of &#34;permanent agriculture&#34; or &#34;permanent culture.&#34; Permaculture is about designing ecological human habitats and food production systems. It is a land use and community building movement which strives for the harmonious integration of human dwellings, microclimate, annual and perennial plants, animals, soils, and water into stable, productive communities. The focus is not on these elements themselves, but rather on the relationships created among them by the way we place them in the landscape. This synergy is further enhanced by mimicking patterns found in nature.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Racing in the Rain</h2><p>*** SHIPS the SAME DAY from GA, United States. *** Excellent condition (brand new), unmarked, clean, crisp and tightly bound.

He is the author of <i>Rave On: The Biography of Buddy Holly</i> and many other books.CHAPTER ONE: <b>"HE WAS THE ONE I'D WAITED FOR"</b> <p> John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, during a brief respite in Nazi Germany's bombing of Liverpool. All summer, after tea, people would switch on their radios at low volume, listening, not to the muted dance music but to the sky outside their open back doors. When the music cut off, before the first siren went, you knew that the bombers were returning. </p><p> Liverpool paid a heavy price for its naval shipyards, and for the miles of docks where convoys stood making ready to brave the North Atlantic. The city was Britain's last loophole for overseas food supplies. Night after night, with geometric accuracy, explosions tore along the seaming of wharves and warehouses and black castle walls, and over the tramlines into streets of friendly red back-to-back houses, of pubs and missions and corner dairies with cowsheds behind. During the worst week so many ships lay sunk along the Mersey there was not a single berth free for incoming cargo. But on Lime Street the Empire theater carried on performances as usual. Sometimes the whole audience would crowd out into the foyer and look across the black acropolis of St. George's Hall to a sky flashing white, then dark again as more bombs pummeled the port and the river. </p><p> Mimi Stanley had always worried about her younger sister, Julia. She worried about her especially tonight with more Luftwaffe raids expected and Julia in labor in the Oxford Street maternity home. When news of the baby came by telephone Mimi set out on foot from the Stanley house on Newcastle Road. "I ran two miles. I couldn't stop thinking, 'It's a boy, it's a boy. He's the one I've waited for.' " </p><p> She held John in her arms twenty minutes after he was born. His second name, Julia said -- in honor of Britain's inspirational prime minister, Winston Churchill -- would be Winston. Just then a parachute-borne land mine fell directly outside the hospital. "But my sister stayed in bed," Mimi said, "and they put the baby under the bed. They wanted me to go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran all the way back to Newcastle Road to tell Father the news. 'Get under shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them. Father was there, and I said, 'It's a boy and he's beautiful, he's the best one of all.' Father looked up and said, 'Oh heck, he <i>would</i> be.' " </p><p> Mimi's and Julia's father was an official with the Glasgow and Liverpool Salvage Company. He was aboard the salvage tug that tried to raise the submarine <i>Thetis</i> from her deathbed in Liverpool Bay. He had five daughters and brought them up strictly, though he was often away from home salvaging ships. "We loved Father," Mimi said, "but we liked it when he went away to sea and we girls could kick over the traces a bit. If ever there was a boy I had my eye on, I used to pray at night, 'Please God, let no one be hurt but let there be a wreck.' " </p><p> Mimi was slender, brisk, and dark, with fine cheekbones like a Cherokee. Julia was slim, auburn-haired, more conventionally pretty. Both loved laughter, but Mimi insisted there should be sense in it. "Oh, Julia," she would endlessly plead, "be <i>serious."</i> Julia could never be serious about anything. </p><p> Her marriage to Freddy Lennon in 1938 had been the least serious act of her life. She met Freddy one day in Sefton Park, and commented on the silly hat he wore. To please her, Freddy sent it skimming into the lake. She started bringing him home, to her whole family's great dismay. He was only a ship's waiter, erratically employed; he preferred, in the nautical term for malingering, to "swallow the anchor." Julia married him on an impulse at Mount Pleasant Register Office, putting down her occupation as "cinema usherette" because she knew how it would annoy her father. "I'll never forget that day," Mimi said. "Julia came home, threw a piece of paper on the table and said, 'There, that's it. I've married him.' " </p><p> Within little more than a year, World War II had broken out, sending Freddy to sea on a succession of merchant ships and condemning Julia to a life of alternating grim boredom and terror in the Liverpool Blitz. Freddie was doing war work requiring as much courage and self-sacrifice as any other. But he also loved shipboard life, where he was always the star turn in amateur concerts, "blacking up" like Al Jolson or singing torrid ballads like "Begin the Beguine." </p><p> After John was born, in 1940, Freddie's spells of shore leave became increasingly more erratic. His longest absence was a bizarre eighteen-month odyssey that saw him variously arrested for deserting his ship in New York and stranded in B�ne, North Africa, while, back home in Liverpool, his family presumed him dead and payment of his wages to Julia was suspended. When eventually he arrived home, it was to find Julia pregnant by another man, a Welsh soldier stationed in Liverpool. The baby, a girl, baptized Victoria Elizabeth, was born in 1945, a few weeks after the war's end. Freddie was willing to forgive Julia, adopt Victoria, and bring her up alongside John. But Julia's family, fearing a public disgrace, insisted that the baby must be put out for adoption. </p><p> Though his marriage was clearly on the rocks, Freddie was unwilling to relinquish John. In April 1946, hearing that Julia had acquired a new man friend, he abducted John and fled with him to the seaside resort of Blackpool, planning vaguely for the two of them to emigrate to New Zealand. Before he could take the scheme further, however, Julia turned up in Blackpool and announced she was taking John home to Liverpool. The six-year-old was then faced with an agonizing choice: "Do you want to go with Mummy or Daddy?" He chose Julia. A crushed Freddie made no move to keep them from going off together. </p><p> All Julia's sisters lent a hand in caring for John. But one sister cared specially -- the one who, having no babies of her own, ran through the air raid to hold him. From the moment John could talk, he would say, "Where's Mimi? Where's Mimi's house?" </p><p> "Julia had met someone else, with whom she had a chance of happiness," Mimi said. "And no man wants another man's child. That's when I said I wanted to bring John to Menlove Avenue to live with George and me. I wouldn't even let him risk being hurt or feeling he was in the way. I made up my mind that I'd be the one to give him what every child has the right to -- a safe and happy home life." </p><p> The fires ceased falling on Liverpool. The city, though cratered like a Roman ruin, returned to its old, majestically confident commercial life. St. George's Hall, badly scarred, still stood within its columns, between equestrian statues of Victoria and Albert. Along the docks, the overhead railway remained intact, passing above the funnels and warehouses and branching masts, the horse-drawn wagons and clanking, shuffling "Green Goddess" Liverpool trams. Business resumed in the streets lined by statues and colonnades and Moorish arches and huge public clocks. At the Pier Head, that broad riverfront, congregations of trams drew up between the Mersey and its three gray waterside temples: the Cunard Company, the Docks and Harbour Board, and the Royal Liver Insurance Company. The "Liver building" was still there, its twin belfries soaring higher than the seagulls and crowned with the skittish stone silhouettes of the "Liver birds." </p><p> Liverpool was still business and banking and insurance -- and ships. From the southern headland, under rings of tall cranes, came the rhythmic clout of Cammell Laird's yard where they built the <i>Alabama,</i> the <i>Mauretania,</i> the <i>Ark Royal,</i> the Thetis. Across from Birkenhead, brisk river ferries crossed the path of ocean liners, warships, merchantmen, and the smaller fry of what was still Europe's busiest shipping pool. Ever and again, from a slipway on the broad river bend, some fresh ungarnished hull would slide backward, and ride there, free of drag chains, while tug whoops mingled with cheers from the bank. </p><p> Liverpool was docks and ships and as such indistinguishable in Britain's northern industrial fogs but for one additional, intermittent product: Liverpool was where music-hall comedians, such as Tommy Handley, Arthur Askey, and Robb Wilton, came from. Some elixir in a population mixed from Welsh and Irish, and also lascar and Chinese, and uttered in the strange glottal dialect that simultaneously seems to raise derisive eyebrows, had always possessed the power to make the rest of the country laugh. </p><p> Liverpool "comics" were always preferred by the London theatrical agents. But there was a proviso. It was better for them to lose their Liverpool accents, and omit all references to the city of their origin. No one in London cared about a place so far to the northwest, so gray and sooty and old-fashioned, and above all, so utterly without glamour as Liverpool. </p><p> Woolton, where John grew up, is a suburb six miles to the southeast, but further in spirit, from the Liverpool of docks and Chinatown and pub signs pasted round every street corner. From Lime Street you drive uphill, past the grand old Adelphi Hotel, past the smaller backstreet hotels with no pretense at grandeur, past the Baptist temples and Irish meeting halls and grassed-over bomb sites turned into eternal temporary parking lots, lapping against some isolated little waterworks or church. Eventually you come to a traffic circle known by the name of its smallest tributary, Penny Lane. Woolton lies beyond, in wide dual carriageways with grass verges and mock Tudor villas whose gardens adjoin parks, country clubs, and golf courses. </p><p> Woolton, in fact, is such a respectable, desirable, and featureless suburb as grows up close to any British industrial city. Until 1963, it had only one claim on history. A lord of the same name was Britain's wartime minister of food and inventor of the "Woolton Pie," which boasted total, if unappetizing, nourishment for only one old shilling a portion. </p><p> The country village that Woolton used to be is still distinguishable in narrow lanes winding up to its red sandstone parish church, St. Peter's. In the early 1940s, it wa...</p></p><h2>Useful Enemies: John Demjanjuk and America&#39;s Open-Door Policy for Nazi War Criminals</h2><p><p>John &#x201c;Iwan&#x201d; Demjanjuk was at the center of one of history&#x2019;s most complex war crimes trials. But why did it take almost sixty years for the United States to bring him to justice as a Nazi collaborator?</p><p>The answer lies in the annals of the Cold War, when fear and paranoia drove American politicians and the U.S. military to recruit &#x201c;useful&#x201d; Nazi war criminals to work for the United States in Europe as spies and saboteurs, and to slip them into America through loopholes in U.S. immigration policy. During and after the war, that same immigration policy was used to prevent thousands of Jewish refugees from reaching the shores of America.</p><p>The long and twisted saga of John Demjanjuk, a postwar immigrant and auto mechanic living a quiet life in Cleveland until 1977, is the final piece in the puzzle of American government deceit. The White House, the Departments of War and State, the FBI and the CIA supported policies that harbored Nazi war criminals and actively worked to hide and shelter them from those who dared to investigate and deport them.</p><p>The heroes in this story are men and women such as Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman and Justice Department prosecutor Eli Rosenbaum, who worked for decades to hold hearings, find and investigate alleged Nazi war criminals, and successfully prosecute them for visa fraud. But it was not until the conviction of John Demjanjuk in Munich in 2011 as an SS camp guard serving at the Sobibor death camp that this story of deceit can be told for what it is: a shameful chapter in American history.</p><p>Riveting and deeply researched, <i>Useful Enemies</i> is the account of one man&#x2019;s criminal past and its devastating consequences, and the story of how America sacrificed its moral authority in the wake of history&#x2019;s darkest moment.</p></p><p>Richard Rashke is the author of nonfiction books including the bestselling <i>The Killing of Karen Silkwood</i> and <i>Escape from Sobibor</i>.

Rachel Peyton sat in a booth, gazing out at the street and taking occasional sips of the apple juice she'd ordered. It was Friday, late afternoon, and she'd come here after work to meet a friend. She couldn't stop thinking about her marriage to Bruce, wondering how it had disintegrated so fast. They'd gone from an impromptu wedding last December to separation less than ten months later. She turned her head to look in the direction of Cedar Cove. The town was situated on the other side of Sinclair Inlet but might as well have been across the Pacific.<br><br>Rachel felt she couldn't go back home to Cedar Cove&#x2014;to Yakima Street&#x2014;and yet she had no other viable choice. She'd left after the latest argument with her stepdaughter, Jolene. Although Bruce was aware of the tension between her and Rachel, he'd never adequately addressed it, believing it would eventually resolve itself. Oh, sure, he'd made a halfhearted offer to go to counseling with, or more likely without, Jolene. But that was too little, too late. Nothing had changed, and, as a result, the stress in their home had become intolerable. Now that she was pregnant, Rachel had decided to leave...for the sake of her sanity and for her own health and that of her baby.<br><br>She'd lied to Bruce, saying she had a place to stay&#x2014;with an unidentified friend. Instead, she'd checked into a Bremerton hotel.<br><br>The problem was, she needed her job if she was going to support herself, which meant she'd need to find an apartment in Cedar Cove or at least nearby. Everything was complicated by the fact that this hadn't been an easy pregnancy. She had severe morning sickness and her blood pressure was dangerously high. That was understandable, considering the tension in the house. If not for the baby, Rachel might have found the strength to deal with Jolene. She might've been willing to devote all her energy to sorting out the complicated tangle of the girl's emotions, giving her the constant reassurance she seemed to require.<br><br>Since Jolene had learned about the baby, the whole situation had become that much more difficult. Not only did her stepdaughter see her as competition for Bruce's affections, but now Rachel had committed an even worse crime by bringing another child into the family, robbing the girl of his undivided attention.<br><br>What shocked Rachel was how close she and Jolene had been before she married Bruce. As a motherless child herself, Rachel had taken a special interest in Jolene, part maternal, part friendly. They'd bonded when the girl was just six, a year after Jolene's mother was killed in a car accident. Bruce had brought Jolene into the salon for a haircut and Jolene had sadly told her how much she missed her mommy. Rachel had been drawn to the child because she'd identified with Jolene. She still recalled in vivid detail how she'd felt when her own mother had died and she'd gone to live with her mother's sister, a woman she barely knew.<br><br>Through the years, the closeness between Rachel and Jolene had grown&#x2014;until she'd made the mistake of marrying Jolene's father. To be fair to the teenager, Jolene had wanted Rachel and Bruce to wait until she'd had time to get used to the idea. Bruce, however, wouldn't hear of it. He'd wanted them married. Well, so did Rachel, although she'd asked Bruce to delay the wedding because of Jolene's qualms. But by then...the momentum of their plans had taken over.<br><br>In the beginning, after first meeting Bruce, she hadn't considered him anything more than a friend. He was Jolene's dad. He relied on her help with his daughter. For years there hadn't been the slightest indication of romantic interest on either part. Rachel was seeing Nate Olsen, a navy warrant officer she'd met after bidding on him at a fundraiser for the local humane society&#x2014;the Dog and Bachelor Auction. Shortly after the wedding, Nate was deployed out of state, but now he was back. They'd been in contact recently and, in fact, he was the friend she'd arranged to meet here.<br><br>For a while she and Nate had seriously thought about marriage. However, by the time he'd asked her to make a decision, Rachel had come to realize she was in love with Bruce. Surprisingly, miraculously, Bruce loved her, too. From there everything had moved quickly. <em>Too </em>quickly...<br><br>She had to acknowledge the truth of that old cliche about marrying in haste. Rachel had been all too willing to accept Bruce's assurances that Jolene would adjust. After all, he'd pointed out, it wasn't as though Rachel was a <em>stranger.</em><br><br>But Jolene hadn't adjusted. Whatever affection she'd had for Rachel had changed into passive-aggressive behavior and then escalated to open antagonism. Not wanting to distress her husband, Rachel had done her best to deflect Jolene's hostility. The pregnancy was unplanned, and she'd hoped to keep it a secret for a few months, but Bruce insisted it was only right to tell Jolene. That, too, had backfired. And it had led to this.<br><br>The caf� door opened but Rachel didn't look up until Nate Olsen slid into the booth across from her.<br><br>"Rachel?"<br><br>She glanced up and offered him a weak smile.<br><br>Nate's blue eyes narrowed slightly. "You okay?" he asked, sounding concerned.<br><br>"You don't have to say it. I look terrible."<br><br>"Not terrible," he said. "Just...very pale."<br><br>Nate had emailed her when he returned to Bremerton. He felt she should know so that if they inadvertently ran into each other, she'd be prepared. With everything else that was happening, Rachel hadn't paid much attention to his email and hadn't responded. Nate was someone she'd loved in the past. She was a married woman now.<br><br>With time on her hands at the hotel, she'd gone to the business center and logged on to her email account. She'd impulsively answered his message, telling him that her marriage was falling apart. After they'd exchanged a few short emails, Nate suggested they meet. She'd accepted his invitation.<br><br>"At my last doctor's visit I learned I have an iron deficiency." It didn't help that she hadn't been able to keep down a meal. Her morning sickness lingered for most of the day, making her feel too queasy and uncomfortable to eat. She'd lost weight when she should be gaining.<br><br>"I'm glad you got in touch."<br><br>"I probably shouldn't have." Only Rachel didn't know who else to contact. She couldn't reach out to her friends; they were the first people Bruce would approach. This separation was difficult enough without dragging her friends into the middle of it.<br><br>"I meant what I said," Nate continued. "If you ever need anything, call me. You know I'll do whatever I can."<br><br>When the waitress came over to the table with a coffeepot, Nate turned over his ceramic mug and she filled it.<br><br>At his words, tears of appreciation sprang to Rachel's eyes. "I know."<br><br>"What can I do?"<br><br>She wasn't sure. "Like I said in my email, I...I've left Bruce and Jolene." It went without saying that this fit right into her stepdaughter's plans. Undoubtedly Jolene was ecstatic about having her father to herself again.<br><br>"So it's come to that?"<br><br>Rachel's dark hair fell forward as she looked down. "I...talked to Teri and she wants me to move in with her."<br><br>"Are you going to?"<br><br>"I can't. That'll be the first place Bruce goes. I told him I was moving in with a friend.... At the time I thought I might take Teri up on her offer, but I can't do that to her. She and Bobby have their hands full with the three babies."<br><br><em>"Three?"</em><br><br>"Teri had triplets."<br><br>Nate laughed. That seemed to be a common reaction when people heard about the triplets. "She always does everything in a big way, doesn't she?" he murmured.<br><br>He knew Teri, so he also knew that if anyone could handle this, it was her friend. But capable though she was, Teri didn't need a miserable friend to deal with, in addition to caring for three babies. <br><br>"So, if you don't move in with Teri, where will you go?"<br><br>"I.I don't know." All that mattered was getting out of the house as fast as possible. She got a hotel room, but that was far too expensive to be a permanent solution. At this rate she'd drain her bank account in a week. Besides, it wouldn't take Bruce long to discover where she was, and once he did, he'd do whatever he could to convince her to return home. Rachel couldn't allow that to happen, not while the situation with Jolene was still unsettled.<br><br>Nate sipped his coffee in thoughtful silence. Eventually he said, "You could always move in with me."<br><br>Rachel's head shot up. That wasn't even a consideration. If Bruce learned she was living with Nate he'd feel blindsided. Besides, it would give Jolene more ammunition to use against her. "I'm grateful for the offer, I really am, but I couldn't possibly do that."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"Nate, I couldn't.... What would Bruce think?"<br><br>"Do you need to tell him?"<br><br>"I..." She opened her mouth to object, then merely said, "He'd want to know."<br><br>"Of course he would, but you don't have to tell him <em>everything. </em>The only important thing here is that you're somewhere safe and that you're taking care of yourself."<br><br>Rachel stared at him. "Are you suggesting I lie to my husband?"<br><br>"Not lie, exactly. I'm saying don't fill in all the blanks. As it happens, the house I'm sharing belongs to a friend of mine. I have a room, but there's a third bedroom available. Unfortunately, Bob's deployed right now, so it would just be the two of us. If you're uncomfortable with that, I understand."<br><br>She exhaled, feeling torn. His idea did seem like a good solution, but she could only imagine how Bruce would react if he discovered the truth. For obvious reasons, the two men weren't on the best of terms.<br><br>"It might help you decide if I tell you I'm seeing someone."<br><br>Actually, that did help. "Is it serious?" Rachel asked.<br><br>Nate shrugged. "Serious enough. I'm out with Emily three or four nights a week. You'd have the house to yourself most of the time."<br><br>"What kind of rent does Bob charge?"<br><br>Nate mentioned an amount that was more than reasonable, then added, "You wouldn't be expected to cook or clean or anything else if that's what you're thinking."<br><br>"Oh." She nibbled her lower lip as she considered his suggestion. He'd given her an option she hadn't expected.<br><br>"Before you answer, why don't you come over and check out the place."<br><br>Still, she hesitated.<br><br>"You want to get away for a while, don't you?" She did, and Nate knew that. "Someplace where Bruce and his daughter would never think of looking?" She nodded slowly.<br><br>"Don't worry about me," Nate told her once again. "I loved you, Rachel, I really did, but I've moved on. However, I care about you, which is why I brought up this arrangement. If you're concerned about what might result from the two of us being in the same house, then let me assure you right now, nothing's going to happen."<br><br>"Okay," she whispered. "I'll go see the place."<br><br>"Good." He left money to pay for their drinks, then slid out of the booth.<br><br>Rachel stood and immediately felt dizzy. She would have stumbled if Nate hadn't grabbed her elbow.<br><br>"When's the last time you ate?"<br><br>She closed her eyes and tried to remember. "A while ago. I'm fine."<br><br>"No, you aren't. Listen, no arguments. Once you've toured the house, I'm fixing you something to eat."<br><br>"You cook?"<br><br>"I'm surprised you don't remember that I'm a man of many talents."<br><br>His smile was just the salve she needed, his friendship the mainstay that would see her through this upheaval in her life.<br><br>She followed Nate to the Bremerton address he gave her. The house was in a nearby neighborhood, convenient to the navy base. The two-story structure, built after the Second World War, had a large front porch and shuttered windows. It was meant for a family.<br><br>Unexpected emotion swelled up inside Rachel as she looked at the house. Her mother had been a single parent and her aunt had never married. All her life Rachel had yearned to be part of a family. When she married Bruce, she'd felt as if she finally belonged. She had a husband and a stepdaughter and they were bonded together by love. It didn't take long for that dream to shatter and now, once more, she was on the outside. . The baby stirred, and she pressed her palm against her stomach, hoping her child would one day know the love of a father, a mother and a big sister.<br><br>"Would you like to come in?" Nate asked, again clasping her elbow as though he feared she might crumple onto the pavement.<br><br>Without answering, she accompanied him up the walkway to the steps.<br><br>"I do my best to keep the place neat, but you have to remember I'm a guy and housekeeping is low on my priority list."<br><br>"I'll remember," she said, managing a glimmer of a smile.<br><br></p><h2>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews: A Jewish Life and the Emergence of Christianity</h2><p>In her new book, the acclaimed historian of Christianity gives us a portrait of Jesus that departs radically from the traditional. Paula Fredriksendraws on the narratives of all four evangelists, both John and the Synoptics, as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish authorities of Jesus' time -- Philo, Paul, and Josephus -- who wrote in Greek, and early rabbinic writings. She shows us a historical Jesus living in the tumultuous world of late-Second Temple Judaism: an observant Jew of his time, a prophetic teacher who traveled through the villages of Galilee and frequently in and around Jerusalem. At the center of her book she brings us to the questions raised by the least disputed fact about Jesus' life: his death. Jesus was executed by the Roman prefect, Pilate, on or around Passover, in the manner Rome reserved particularly for political insurrectionists -- crucifixion. Pilate could not have planned this very imperial death for a Jesus concerned purely with Jewish controversy.<br>Why was crucifixion chosen as the means of execution? If Jesus was executed as a political insurrectionist, why were none of his followers executed or even arrested?<br>The author's quest in search of the answers takes us through the religious world -- Jewish and pagan -- of Mediterranean antiquity, through the tangle of Judean and Galilean politics, and through the surprisingly intimate social interactions of Jewish and gentile communities in the ancient city. And it is through the Gospel of John -- a text out of favor in most academic reconstructions -- that she finds the answer to the interpretive dilemma posed by Jesus' execution and his disciples' survival.<br>She shows us a Jesus firmly situated in his native religious milieu, a Jesus whose mission and message, whose Jewish life and Roman death, account for his movement's rapid spread through territorial Israel to diaspora synagogues, its ready embrace of Gentiles, and its enduring commitment to the message of the crucified Messiah and the coming of the Kingdom of God.<br><b>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</b> won the 1999 National Jewish Book Award in the category of Jewish-Christian Relations.</p><p>The epigraph to <i>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</i> by Paula Fredriksen includes the following observation by Matteo Ricci: "[A]ll things (including those that at last come to triumph mightily) are at their beginnings so small and faint in outline that one cannot easily convince oneself that from them will grow matters of great moment." This little thought helps to explain Fredriksen's big one, that no one during Jesus' lifetime (including the man himself) considered Jesus to be the Messiah. That interpretation of his life, Fredriksen argues, was occasioned by his death: "Jesus' crucifixion as King of the Jews had come as a shock to his core followers. Their experiences of his continued presence after his death, on the evidence of the Gospels, surprised them, too. Seeking to understand what they had witnessed, they turned to Scripture." <i>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</i> makes its argument through careful reconstruction of Jesus' historical context, and dogged attention to the details of his crucifixion and to the fates of his immediate followers. The book's surprising arguments and its lucid style make this a valuable addition to the canon of popular Historical Jesus scholarship. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"A captivating, plausible, but surely controversial interpretation of Jesus, and particularly of his death...that departs dramatically from tradition." <br> --<i>Boston Globe</i><br><p>"An important contribution."<br> --<i> Booklist</i><br></p><p>"Why was Jesus killed?...Fredriksen's search for an answer is almost a detective story...refreshingly independent of dogma and cant."<br> -- <i>Atlanta Journal Constitution</i><br></p><p>"A marvelous book...Fredriksen's exercises in historical investigation are riveting."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- <i>Bostonia</i></p></p><h2>The G�ttingen Dogmatics: Instruction in the Christian Religion</h2><p>One of the greatest theologians of the twentieth century, Karl Barth is best known for his monumental<i>Church Dogmatics,</i> a work that changed the modern theological landscape. It is less well known that Barth taught three distinct cycles of course sin dogmatics during his lifetime. His first effort consisted of a series of lectures at the University of Gottingen in 1924-1925. These provocative lectures are available in English in <i>The Gottingen Dogmatics,</i> an accessible and profoundly pastoral work.<br>A superb, substantive introduction by Daniel L. Migliore, professor of systematic theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, highlights the theological historical significance of<i>The Gottingen Dogmatics</i> and compares this work with Barth's <i>Church Dogmatics.</i> Migliore points out, among other things, the intimate bond between dogmatics and preaching: in the Gottingen lectures we see a Barth "who tenaciously does theology -- indeed defines theology -- in relation to preaching a pastoral praxis."</p><p>(1886&#x2013;1968) Karl Barth was professor of dogmatictheology at the University of Basel, Switzerland. He isconsidered by some to be the greatest Protestant theologianof the twentieth century and possibly the greatest sincethe Reformation. Among his most famous works are ChurchDogmatics and The Epistle to the Romans.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Ethics for the New Millennium</h2><p>One of humanity&#39;s most respected figures presents a plan for a new human and social paradigm, arguing that humankind is not inherently sinful, and discussing how redirection in the perception of our fundamental natures can bring powerful and positive change. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>In a modern society characterized by insensitivity to violence, ambivalence to the suffering of others, and a high-octane profit motive, is talk of ethics anything more than a temporary salve for our collective conscience? The Dalai Lama thinks so. In his <i>Ethics for the New Millennium</i>, the exiled leader of the Tibetan people shows how the basic concerns of all people--happiness based in contentment, appeasement of suffering, forging meaningful relationships--can act as the foundation for a universal ethics. <p> His medicine isn't always easy to swallow, however, for it demands of the reader more than memorizing precepts or positing hypothetical dilemmas. The Nobel Peace laureate invites us to recognize certain basic facts of existence, such as the interdependence of all things, and from these to recalibrate our hearts and minds, to approach all of our actions in their light. Nothing short of an inner revolution will do. Basic work is required in nurturing our innate tendencies to compassion, tolerance, and generosity. And at the same time, "we need to think, think, think ... like a scientist," reasoning out the best ways to act from a principle of universal responsibility. Like a merging of the care and compassion of Jesus, the cool rationality of the Stoics, the moral program of Ben Franklin, and the psychology of William James, <i>Ethics for the New Millennium</i> is a plea for basic goodness, a blueprint for world peace. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people. His tireless efforts on behalf of human rights and world peace have brought him international recognition.

A given amount of emission will lead to a given amount of temperature increase that will lead to a given amount of smooth incremental sea level rise. However, the geological record for the climate reflects instances where a relatively small change in one element of climate led to abrupt changes in the system as a whole. In other words, pushing global temperatures past certain thresholds could trigger abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and large-scale impacts. At that point, even if we do not add any additional CO2 to the atmosphere, potentially unstoppable processes are set in motion. We can think of this as sudden climate brake and steering failure where the problem and its consequences are no longer something we can control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world&#x2019;s largest general scientific society, 20141<br> <br>&#x201c;I love that smell of the emissions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Sarah Palin, 20112<br> <br>A voice came over the intercom: would the passengers of Flight 3935, scheduled to depart Washington, D.C., for Charleston, South Carolina, kindly collect their carry-on luggage and get off the plane.<br> <br>They went down the stairs and gathered on the hot tarmac. There they saw something unusual: the wheels of the US Airways jet had sunk into the black pavement as if it were wet cement. The wheels were lodged so deep, in fact, that the truck that came to tow the plane away couldn&#x2019;t pry it loose. The airline had hoped that without the added weight of the flight&#x2019;s thirty-five passengers, the aircraft would be light enough to pull. It wasn&#x2019;t. Someone posted a picture: &#x201c;Why is my flight cancelled? Because DC is so damn hot that our plane sank 4" into the pavement.&#x201d;3<br> <br>Eventually, a larger, more powerful vehicle was brought in to tow the plane and this time it worked; the plane finally took off, three hours behind schedule. A spokesperson for the airline blamed the incident on &#x201c;very unusual temperatures.&#x201d;4<br> <br>The temperatures in the summer of 2012 were indeed unusually hot. (As they were the year before and the year after.) And it&#x2019;s no mystery why this has been happening: the profligate burning of fossil fuels, the very thing that US Airways was bound and determined to do despite the inconvenience presented by a melting tarmac. This irony&#x2014;the fact that the burning of fossil fuels is so radically changing our climate that it is getting in the way of our capacity to burn fossil fuels&#x2014;did not stop the passengers of Flight 3935 from reembarking and continuing their journeys. Nor was climate change mentioned in any of the major news coverage of the incident.<br> <br>I am in no position to judge these passengers. All of us who live high consumer lifestyles, wherever we happen to reside, are, metaphorically, passengers on Flight 3935. Faced with a crisis that threatens our survival as a species, our entire culture is continuing to do the very thing that caused the crisis, only with an extra dose of elbow grease behind it. Like the airline bringing in a truck with a more powerful engine to tow that plane, the global economy is upping the ante from conventional sources of fossil fuels to even dirtier and more dangerous versions&#x2014;bitumen from the Alberta tar sands, oil from deepwater drilling, gas from hydraulic fracturing (fracking), coal from detonated mountains, and so on.<br> <br>Meanwhile, each supercharged natural disaster produces new irony-laden snapshots of a climate increasingly inhospitable to the very industries most responsible for its warming. Like the 2013 historic floods in Calgary that forced the head offices of the oil companies mining the Alberta tar sands to go dark and send their employees home, while a train carrying flammable petroleum products teetered on the edge of a disintegrating rail bridge. Or the drought that hit the Mississippi River one year earlier, pushing water levels so low that barges loaded with oil and coal were unable to move for days, while they waited for the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a channel (they had to appropriate funds allocated to rebuild from the previous year&#x2019;s historic flooding along the same waterway). Or the coal-fired power plants in other parts of the country that were temporarily shut down because the waterways that they draw on to cool their machinery were either too hot or too dry (or, in some cases, both).<br> <br>Living with this kind of cognitive dissonance is simply part of being alive in this jarring moment in history, when a crisis we have been studiously ignoring is hitting us in the face&#x2014;and yet we are doubling down on the stuff that is causing the crisis in the first place.<br> <br>I denied climate change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. Not like Donald Trump and the Tea Partiers going on about how the continued existence of winter proves it&#x2019;s all a hoax. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most of the news stories, especially the really scary ones. I told myself the science was too complicated and that the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my &#x201c;elite&#x201d; frequent flyer status.<br> <br>A great many of us engage in this kind of climate change denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or we look but then turn it into a joke (&#x201c;more signs of the Apocalypse!&#x201d;). Which is another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves comforting stories about how humans are clever and will come up with a technological miracle that will safely suck the carbon out of the skies or magically turn down the heat of the sun. Which, I was to discover while researching this book, is yet another way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but try to be hyper-rational about it (&#x201c;dollar for dollar it&#x2019;s more efficient to focus on economic development than climate change, since wealth is the best protection from weather extremes&#x201d;)&#x2014;as if having a few more dollars will make much difference when your city is underwater. Which is a way of looking away if you happen to be a policy wonk.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves we are too busy to care about something so distant and abstract&#x2014;even though we saw the water in the subways in New York City, and the people on their rooftops in New Orleans, and know that no one is safe, the most vulnerable least of all. And though perfectly understandable, this too is a way of looking away.<br> <br>Or we look but tell ourselves that all we can do is focus on ourselves. Meditate and shop at farmers&#x2019; markets and stop driving&#x2014;but forget trying to actually change the systems that are making the crisis inevitable because that&#x2019;s too much &#x201c;bad energy&#x201d; and it will never work. And at first it may appear as if we are looking, because many of these lifestyle changes are indeed part of the solution, but we still have one eye tightly shut.<br> <br>Or maybe we do look&#x2014;really look&#x2014;but then, inevitably, we seem to forget. Remember and then forget again. Climate change is like that; it&#x2019;s hard to keep it in your head for very long. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right.5<br> <br>We know that if we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, climate change will change everything about our world. Major cities will very likely drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas, and there is a very high chance that our children will spend a great deal of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. And we don&#x2019;t have to do anything to bring about this future. All we have to do is nothing. Just continue to do what we are doing now, whether it&#x2019;s counting on a techno-fix or tending to our gardens or telling ourselves we&#x2019;re unfortunately too busy to deal with it.<br> <br>All we have to do is not react as if this is a full-blown crisis. All we have to do is keep on denying how frightened we actually are. And then, bit by bit, we will have arrived at the place we most fear, the thing from which we have been averting our eyes. No additional effort required.<br> <br>There are ways of preventing this grim future, or at least making it a lot less dire. But the catch is that these also involve changing everything. For us high consumers, it involves changing how we live, how our economies function, even the stories we tell about our place on earth. The good news is that many of these changes are distinctly un-catastrophic. Many are downright exciting. But I didn&#x2019;t discover this for a long while.<br> <br>I remember the precise moment when I stopped averting my eyes to the reality of climate change, or at least when I first allowed my eyes to rest there for a good while. It was in Geneva, in April 2009, and I was meeting with Bolivia&#x2019;s ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO), who was then a surprisingly young woman named Ang�lica Navarro Llanos. Bolivia being a poor country with a small international budget, Navarro Llanos had recently taken on the climate portfolio in addition to her trade responsibilities. Over lunch in an empty Chinese restaurant, she explained to me (using chopsticks as props to make a graph of the global emission trajectory) that she saw climate change both as a terrible threat to her people&#x2014;but also an opportunity.<br> <br>A threat for the obvious reasons: Bolivia is extraordinarily dependent on glaciers for its drinking and irrigation water and those white-capped mountains that tower over its capital were turning gray and brown at an alarming rate. The opportunity, Navarro Llanos said, was that since countries like hers had done almost nothing to send emissions soaring, they were in a position to declare themselves &#x201c;climate creditors,&#x201d; owed money and technology support from the large emitters to defray the hefty costs of coping with more climate-related disasters, as well as to help them develop on a green energy path.<br> <br>She had recently given a speech at a United Nations climate conference in which she laid out the case for these kinds of wealth transfers, and she gave me a copy. &#x201c;Millions of people,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;in small islands, least-developed countries, landlocked countries as well as vulnerable communities in Brazil, India and China, and all around the world&#x2014;are suffering from the effects of a problem to which they did not contribute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If we are to curb emissions in the next decade, we need a massive mobilization larger than any in history. We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth. This plan must mobilize financing and technology transfer on scales never seen before. It must get technology onto the ground in every country to ensure we reduce emissions while raising people&#x2019;s quality of life. We have only a decade.&#x201d;6<br> <br>Of course a Marshall Plan for the Earth would be very costly&#x2014;hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars (Navarro Llanos was reluctant to name a figure). And one might have thought that the cost alone would make it a nonstarter&#x2014;after all, this was 2009 and the global financial crisis was in full swing. Yet the grinding logic of austerity&#x2014;passing on the bankers&#x2019; bills to the people in the form of public sector layoffs, school closures, and the like&#x2014;had not yet been normalized. So rather than making Navarro Llanos&#x2019;s ideas seem less plausible, the crisis had the opposite effect.<br> <br>We had all just watched as trillions of dollars were marshaled in a moment when our elites decided to declare a crisis. If the banks were allowed to fail, we were told, the rest of the economy would collapse. It was a matter of collective survival, so the money had to be found. In the process, some rather large fictions at the heart of our economic system were exposed (Need more money? Print some!). A few years earlier, governments took a similar approach to public finances after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In many Western countries, when it came to constructing the security/surveillance state at home and waging war abroad, budgets never seemed to be an issue.<br> <br>Climate change has never received the crisis treatment from our leaders, despite the fact that it carries the risk of destroying lives on a vastly greater scale than collapsed banks or collapsed buildings. The cuts to our greenhouse gas emissions that scientists tell us are necessary in order to greatly reduce the risk of catastrophe are treated as nothing more than gentle suggestions, actions that can be put off pretty much indefinitely. Clearly, what gets declared a crisis is an expression of power and priorities as much as hard facts. But we need not be spectators in all this: politicians aren&#x2019;t the only ones with the power to declare a crisis. Mass movements of regular people can declare one too.<br> <br>Slavery wasn&#x2019;t a crisis for British and American elites until abolitionism turned it into one. Racial discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the civil rights movement turned it into one. Sex discrimination wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until feminism turned it into one. Apartheid wasn&#x2019;t a crisis until the anti-apartheid movement turned it into one.<br> <br>In the very same way, if enough of us stop looking away and decide that climate change is a crisis worthy of Marshall Plan levels of response, then it will become one, and the political class will have to respond, both by making resources available and by bending the free market rules that have proven so pliable when elite interests are in peril. We occasionally catch glimpses of this potential when a crisis puts climate change at the front of our minds for a while. &#x201c;Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed for it will be spent,&#x201d; declared British prime minister David Cameron&#x2014;Mr. Austerity himself&#x2014;when large parts of his country were underwater from historic flooding in February 2014 and the public was enraged that his government was not doing more to help.7<br> <br>Listening to Navarro Llanos describe Bolivia&#x2019;s perspective, I began to understand how climate change&#x2014;if treated as a true planetary emergency akin to those rising flood waters&#x2014;could become a galvanizing force for humanity, leaving us all not just safer from extreme weather, but with societies that are safer and fairer in all kinds of other ways as well. The resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swaths of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity. This is a vision of the future that goes beyond just surviving or enduring climate change, beyond &#x201c;mitigating&#x201d; and &#x201c;adapting&#x201d; to it in the grim language of the United Nations. It is a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere that seems, frankly, better than where we are right now.<br> <br>After that conversation, I found that I no longer feared immersing myself in the scientific reality of the climate threat. I stopped avoiding the articles and the scientific studies and read everything I could find. I also stopped outsourcing the problem to the environmentalists, stopped telling myself this was somebody else&#x2019;s issue, somebody else&#x2019;s job. And through conversations with others in the growing climate justice movement, I began to see all kinds of ways that climate change could become a catalyzing force for positive change&#x2014;how it could be the best argument progressi...</p><h2>The Fallen Angels and Heroes of Mythology</h2><p>In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth...

K. CHESTERTON<br> <br>The knock on the passenger-side window was so loud and unexpected it startled them both&#x2014;father and son. That the father had been in the middle of an ATM withdrawal, cash in hand, only heightened his anxiety. But when he turned toward the sound of the knocking, his reflexes now on full alert, heart pounding, there was only a frail old woman standing at the passenger window, her nose nearly touching it, looking timid and more frightened than he was. The father almost laughed out loud. She&#x2019;d scared the wits out of both of them! &#x201c;Son, roll down your window, please,&#x201d; he said. For his son&#x2019;s sake he tried to sound more confident than he felt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there any way you could help me get some food for my grandchildren?&#x201d; the old woman asked.<br> <br>The father, a former lawyer recently turned pastor, was skeptical. He saw no reason to be afraid of this woman, but neither did he see any reason to trust that she was telling the truth. Was this a scam? It didn&#x2019;t help that his son, his face turned away from the woman only two feet behind him, pled desperately with his eyes: No!<br> <br>The father recalled a conversation he and I had had only weeks before about why we&#x2019;re often so reluctant to simply obey God when he offers us unexpected or inconvenient assignments. This one seemed to qualify on both counts.<br> <br>Nevertheless, he invited her to get in the car and they went off to the grocery store. As they were loading the bags in the trunk, the father made the mistake of asking if there was anything else she needed. Reluctantly, the woman mentioned that she also had a prescription for medication she couldn&#x2019;t afford. So of course more of the ATM cash disappeared at the pharmacy.<br> <br>When the father offered to drive her and her groceries home, she was both surprised and grateful. She sat quietly in the backseat for most of the trip, but as they neared her home, she asked, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Christians, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought so. Just before I saw your car at the ATM, I was sitting on the bench at the bus stop and I asked Jesus to send me a Christian.&#x201d;<br> <br>As father and son pulled away from the old woman&#x2019;s house, the son asked a million questions, and the father realized that more had gone on than simply meeting another person&#x2019;s needs. His obedience had created a teachable moment. The son wasn&#x2019;t convinced that this had been the smartest thing his dad had ever done, but he was at least impressed with his father&#x2019;s spontaneous generosity and willingness to obey God.<br> <br>Almost all of us have done similar things from time to time: random acts of grace and generosity. They make us feel alive, don&#x2019;t they? That&#x2019;s because they give us a taste, a glimpse, of what we were really created for.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s like one of those ads on TV for a new car that they&#x2019;ve not yet released. They&#x2019;re teasing us, tempting us with flashing images as the new model passes through stands of trees, reflected in mirror-smooth lakes. The maker wants to whet our appetites.<br> <br>Your maker does, too. And if you ignore your comfort zone long enough to jump at the chance to be spontaneously generous and kind when God throws those opportunities your way, you may be prompted to ask, What if I could actually live like this every day? Not just giving away money, but giving myself away? What if these spontaneous acts of kindness and obedience happened so frequently, maybe a dozen times a week, that they become as natural and habitual as brushing my teeth or checking my email?<br> <br>The answer is that you&#x2019;d be experiencing the natural consequence of a surrendered life. And in the divine math of the kingdom, when we give ourselves away, we actually discover our true purpose for life&#x2014;the normal Christian life.<br> <br>If you do, your legacy will be a string of a thousand stories, just like these:<br> <br>A woman stood in the checkout line at the supermarket. The poor woman right in front of her, the one trying to corral three small children, was having a meltdown. It was every young mother&#x2019;s nightmare and then some.<br> <br>One of her children was standing, runny nose and all, in the now-empty shopping cart; another was wailing at around a hundred decibels and hugging mom&#x2019;s leg like it was a tree in a hurricane; a third had run off somewhere. Meanwhile, the frantic young mom&#x2019;s only credit card had been denied. She&#x2019;d dumped half the contents of her purse onto the grocery belt and was desperately pawing through the clutter of keys, crumpled receipts, makeup, and baby gear, trying to find enough cash to pay for the groceries, now bagged and ready. Like any good mother, she was also scanning the area for her missing son, in full panic mode.<br> <br>The unfortunate mom appeared to be in her early thirties, but time and life had not been gentle. The lines on her face, the limp strands of hair now straggling across it, and the cheap clothes she wore screamed poor&#x2014;poor financially and poor in spirit. If to such belongs the kingdom of heaven, in the next life she might be queen. But right now, hope for anything other than day-to-day survival had fled; hers was the face of desperation. Suddenly she slowed and stopped, both hands in the pile of purse contents on the checkout counter, eyes staring blankly downward at nothing, as if she had reached the end of her energy and of whatever momentum had been carrying her forward.<br> <br>The woman behind her who&#x2019;d been watching quietly spoke. &#x201c;Here, this ought to take care of it.&#x201d; She handed the clerk her credit card. The clerk looked from the credit card to the startled young mother. Neither seemed to know what to do next.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to do that,&#x201d; the mother said, swiping the hair out of her face. She looked even more embarrassed than before. Finding her drive once again, she resumed clawing through the pile from her purse.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; said the woman in line, discreetly enough to preserve what little was left of the mother&#x2019;s dignity. &#x201c;Please let me do this for you&#x2014;and for your children.&#x201d; She motioned for the clerk to complete the transaction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll watch your groceries if you want to go find your son.&#x201d;<br> <br>The young mother was clearly struggling to understand what had just happened, but with that reminder, her mothering instincts kicked in. After a quick, embarrassed &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she hurriedly dumped her stuff back into her purse and, with one child in her arms and the other clasped tightly by the hand, rushed off in search of her lost lamb.<br> <br>A few moments later, when the Good Samaritan saw the mother returning, family restored, she turned to leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop, please,&#x201d; called the young mother. Dragging her three still-squabbling children up to the cart of bagged groceries, she said to the woman standing next to them, &#x201c;Thank you so much, but have we met?&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman smiled. &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t recall seeing you before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But then why did you offer to pay for my groceries?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Christian,&#x201d; the woman said simply. &#x201c;As I stood behind you, I sensed that God was telling me to pay for your groceries, so I did. Simple as that. Since everything I have belongs to God anyway, he paid your bill&#x2014;not me. Just thank him, if you&#x2019;d like. I hope you have a great day.&#x201d; And with one last smile, the woman turned and left.<br> <br>In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:16)<br> Simple Obedience Isn&#x2019;t Always<p></p> <br>In the two stories I&#x2019;ve shared, God gave directions to his children&#x2014;and they listened and obeyed. Simple as that. But it&#x2019;s not really that simple, is it?<br> <br>At least, it never has been for me.<br> <br>Even though I&#x2019;ve been serious about following Jesus for more than thirty years now, there have been times when I&#x2019;ve been just plain worn-out from life, difficult relationships, even from ministry, from being handed one more &#x201c;opportunity to serve&#x201d; because &#x201c;you&#x2019;re so good at it.&#x201d; And worn-out from trying desperately, at the same time, to stomp out these little brushfires of sin that I knew were holding me back, denying me the joy of my salvation. So, periodically, I would give myself a breather and take a break from serious obedience. I just wanted to veg!<br> <br>Using some internal moral-actuarial table, I would credit myself for church attendance, having personal devotions, giving, and generally being a good guy&#x2014;with offsetting debits for sin. In my mind, and my arrogance, I assumed I had a positive balance compared to most other Christians I knew. I figured I had plenty of carry-forwards.<br> <br>So I&#x2019;d spend a few months waiting around for the Holy Spirit to do what I couldn&#x2019;t (and maybe didn&#x2019;t even really want to, at that time), ignite the fire once again. And that was fine with me. That way I could lay the responsibility for my lukewarm spirituality at his feet; it&#x2019;s up to God to jump-start my spiritual life. I wanted a Road to Damascus experience. Until I got it, I was content to sit out a few innings&#x2014;just happy to be on the team.<br> <br>Those grand epiphanies rarely came. What frightened me more than anything was being spiritually flat for so long that after a while I&#x2019;d get used to it. It scared me to think that I might end up like so many I&#x2019;d known, whose central purposes in life appeared to be killing time pleasantly in warm places, doing a little volunteer work, oh, and of course going to church.<br> <br>Nobody wakes up one morning and makes the decision to be a lukewarm, religious Christian. So, I have a theory. I think we Christians who were once on fire for God often slowly and unconsciously drift toward religious activities, even good ones, because they&#x2019;re relatively convenient and culturally acceptable forms of obedience. It&#x2019;s a faith we can schedule into our busy lives&#x2014;worship at 10:00 a.m., drop our offerings in the plate, Bible study on Tuesdays, volunteer on Wednesdays at 7:00 p.m. It&#x2019;s a spirituality that we can measure ourselves and others by&#x2014;familiar and predictable, and it still leaves 95 percent of our waking hours for ourselves. Just the ticket for a user-friendly religion.<br> <br>Eventually I would come to my senses and spend a few days alone doing serious business with God, crying out to him to forgive my spiritual laziness. And he would, of course. But it troubled me that he had to. Was this a cycle to which I had to simply resign myself?<br> A Rule of Life<p></p> <br>Then a dozen years ago I was introduced to a rule of life so stunningly simple it was almost embarrassing. It gave me a place to begin again when I found myself spiritually on the bench. Its power is in its simplicity, and yet it gets straight to the heart of what it means to actually follow Jesus. It has become the rule for my life, just as it had for the followers of Jesus you met in the preceding stories.<br> <br>A rule of life is just what it sounds like: a motto, vow, or promise which, if lived out courageously and consistently, at some point changes us from who we are to the men and women we truly long to become. Rules of life have been around as long as there have been people who longed to live lives pleasing to God. Samson, St. Francis of Assisi, the Moravians, Billy Graham, and others have all adopted them&#x2014;simple statements of how they believe God intends them to live. Those rules become a compass, helping guide those who follow them to true spiritual north.<br> <br>The 10-Second Rule is a rule of life. In living by it, you&#x2019;ll either become a far more serious follower of Jesus or realize fairly quickly that you just don&#x2019;t have much interest.<br> <br>Obviously, I have no idea where you are on your faith journey. You may still be kicking tires spiritually, still checking Jesus out. Or maybe you&#x2019;re disappointed with God right now because he hasn&#x2019;t yet delivered you from the wreckage you or others have made of your life. Perhaps you&#x2019;ve been a Christian all your life but have resigned yourself to &#x201c;this is as good as it&#x2019;s going to get.&#x201d; Please don&#x2019;t!<br> <br>What is it that causes one believer in Jesus to become a passionate follower, someone whose life significantly impacts other lives, and another to settle for a life of beige Christianity?<br> <br>A decision.<br> <br>A personal decision to be far more serious about being like Jesus, whether anyone else in your life is or not.<br> <br>Jesus&#x2019; call to come follow me hasn&#x2019;t changed in two thousand years. The Rule isn&#x2019;t a new command. It&#x2019;s simply an easy-to-understand, to-the-point reminder of what it actually means to be on this journey with Jesus, to be led by him day by day, minute by minute&#x2014;or even in the next ten seconds!</p><h2>Gertrude Jekyll: A Vision of Garden and Wood</h2><p>Collection of photographs showing the photographer&#39;s interest in photography, gardening, and architecture</p><p>A collection of photographs of her work taken by JekyII herself that show her vision of borders, woodland and terrace plantings, pathways, and architectural features in the garden.

Reissue. <i>NYT. </i>"</p><p><b>Mindhunter</b> enters the minds of some of the country's most notorious serial killers to tell the real-life story of the Investigative Support Unit (ISU) -- the FBI's special force that has assisted state and local police in cracking some of the country's most celebrated serial murder and rape cases. The unit specializes in understanding the chemistry and mechanical workings of the brain's of these serial criminals, and did its homework by interviewing such murderers as Charles Manson and David Berkowitz (the Son of Sam). John Douglas, who worked for the FBI for 25 years, is an authority on the unit, and his book combines the best of nonfiction with that of a murder mystery.He has hunted some of the most notorious and sadistic criminals of our time: The Trailside Killer in San Francisco, the Atlanta Child murderer. He has contronted, interviewed and researched dozens of serial killers and assassins -- including Charles Manson, Richard Speck, John Wayne Gacy, and James Earl Ray -- for a landmark study to understand their motives. To get inside their minds. He is Special Agent John Douglas, the model for law enforcement legend Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris's thrillers <i>Red Dragon</i> and <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, and the man who ushered in a new age in bahavorial science and criminal profiling. Recently retired after twenty-five years of service, John Douglas can finally tell his unique and compelling story. With journalist Mark Olshaker, he gives us a behind the scenes look at his fascinating career, revisiting his journeys into the dark recesses and calculated madness present only in our worst nightmares. This is the true-crime work everyone has been waiting for -- by the Mindhunter himself.</p><h2>The City and the Stars (SFBC 50th Anniversary Collection, 3)</h2><p>Men had built cities before, but never such a city as Diaspar; for millennia its protective dome shutout the creeping decay and danger of the world outside.

It was a cold, mean day, and my mood was not much different. The library was empty at that hour of the morning....It was closed, in fact, but not locked. So I went in.<br><br>Far up at the top of the long stone staircase I could see a small man gesturing at me: waving at me, shouting....But his voice sounded crazy and scattered, like the screeching of a cat or the sound of beer bottles exploding in a garbage compactor. The only words I could hear were OUT and NIGHT.<br><br>When I got about halfway up the stairs I stopped and raised both hands. "Don't worry!" I shouted. "Police!"<br><br>He shuddered and fell back, saying nothing. His eyes were huge and a shudder ran through his body as I approached. "No problem," I said to him. "Just routine police work." I flashed my gold <i>Special DEA Agent badge</i> at him, then reached out to shake hands, but he moaned suddenly and leaped away...and as he collapsed awkwardly on the cold marble floor I saw that his left ankle was encircled by a heavy steel band that was strapped to a black box.<br><br>"What the fuck is <i>that</i> thing?" I asked him, reaching down to help him up. But he scuttled away again; and then he hissed at me.<br><br><i>"You</i> know what it is!" he whimpered. "You filthy murdering <i>pig!"</i><br><br>"What?" I said. "Are you crazy?" Then I jumped down on him and grabbed his foot so I could bring him a little closer. He uttered another sharp, terrified cry as I slid him across the smooth floor and pulled his ankle up to where it was right in front of my eyes.<br><br>"Be quiet," I said. "I want a look at this thing in good light." He struggled briefly, but I quickly stepped over his leg and hyper-extended his knee until he went rigid, then I braced him and examined the box. It was a standard-issue Body Beeper with a lock-on ankle bracelet -- one of the New Age tools now available to law enforcement agencies everywhere, for purposes of electronic House Arrest for those who have been brought <i>within The System,</i> but for whom there is no room in the overcrowded jails, pens, and prisons. The United States of America has more people locked up than any other country in the world, including Cuba and South Africa. Our prison system from coast to coast is bulging at the seams, and hundreds more are being crammed in every day -- more and more of them saddled with the <i>mandatory Sentences</i> and <i>No Parole</i> Provisions that came in with the first Reagan Administration, which began only ten years ago, but it seems like twenty or thirty....<br><br>Indeed. But that is another very long story and we will save it for later....So let's get back to the library and my new buddy, the unfortunate Prisoner that I seized and captured by accident at four o'clock in the morning when I caught him wandering aimlessly through the hallways of a massive public building with his eyes bulged out and his spine like rubber and probably his nuts on fire, too, because he had nothing to say for himself and no excuse for anything.<br><br>He was a loser. A wimp full of fear, with no pride and sure as hell no Money....But I let him go anyway, and we talked for a while in the Men's Room about his problem. We were both nervous, so I went out to the car and got a bag of warm beers, along with a wooden pipe about half-full of good marijuana.<br><br>Soon we were both in a better mood, and I told him I was not really the Police, but just another good old boy with a yen to Read Law for a while and a few hours to spare before my next court appearance.<br><br>He was a first-time offender from Phoenix, serving work-release time in the Library on a six-year Attempted Rape charge that happened when he wandered into the Ladies' Room at the airport and got in a fight with two Mexican women who said they were paid police informants and turned him in as a Sex Offender when the airport police finally ran him down in a false doorway at the far end of the Lost Luggage hangar and dragged him away in handcuffs to the Red Carpet Club where they subjected him to a loud and humiliating Strip Search and beat him on the kidneys with iron gloves.<br><br>He was innocent, he said, but it made no difference....When they finally got him to jail he was charged with nine felonies including Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer, Gross Sexual Imposition, and Possession of 2,000 Marijuana Seeds that fell out of the lining of a suitcase he had borrowed from his son, for the trip.<br><br>That night he was beaten severely in the holding cell by a gang of sodomites who took all his cigarettes and then kicked him into a coma.<br><br>After thirty-three days in the jail hospital, he was assigned to a public defender who laughed at his case and called him "shiteyes" and said it was all a matter of money.<br><br>Ten weeks later, he was assigned to another lawyer who said he had no choice but to plead guilty and take his medicine like a man.<br><br>"I was lucky," he said. "I almost got sixteen years." He grinned happily and stared into my eyes.<br><br>"As it is now, I'll only have to do five."<br><br>He was broken; a niggardly shell of a man, so afraid of the Law and the Cops and the Courts that he felt lucky and grateful to be serving only five years instead of sixteen -- even though he was innocent. But now, after two long years on his knees <i>within The System,</i> he no longer missed standing up.<br><br>It made me nervous, so I started pacing around in circles on the white tile floor and jabbering distractedly at him from time to time....I was thinking; my mind was running at top speed, scanning and sorting my options. They ranged all the way from Dumb and Dangerous to Crazy, Evil, and utterly wrong from the start.<br><br>"Do you keep any whiskey in this place?" I asked him. "We need whiskey. My brain is getting hazy."<br><br>He stared at me for a moment. Then he smiled vaguely and stood up. "Sure," he said. "I think I can put my hands on a pint of Old Crow." He chuckled. "What the hell? I could use some whiskey, myself." He slid down off the marble washbasin where he'd been sitting and shuffled out of the room. He moved quickly and almost gracefully, but the ugly black box on his ankle slowed him down and caused him to walk with a limp.<br><br>I sat on my own basin and drank our last warm beer. What the hell am I doing here? I wondered. I am a Doctor of Journalism and a Man of The Cloth. Why am I slumped in a bathroom at the Public Library at four o'clock in the morning? Drinking whiskey and smoking marijuana with a soul-dead convict who might be taken back in jail at any moment?<br><br>"What's your name?" I asked him as he returned with a half-finished pint of whiskey in a brown bag.<br><br>"Andrew," he said. "They call me Andy."<br><br>"Okay, Andrew," I said. "Give me that whiskey and stand back. We are on the brink. Yes. I have an idea."<br><br>He tossed me the bottle and I drank deeply, then handed it back to him. "Don't worry about having this stuff on your breath when they come for you," I said. "I have a new electric toothbrush out in the car that will sterilize your whole thorax in ten seconds. I also have some very fine cocaine downstairs in the car, which you might want to use when your eyes start looking like they do now...." I slapped him on the leg and hit the Old Crow again. "Hot damn, Andrew!" I barked at him. "We are <i>warriors.</i> The time has come to <i>rumble!"</i><br><br>He said nothing. The bottle of whiskey was tilted high over his face, and I could see that he was finishing it off....So what? I thought. We can always get more. The whiskey stores opened at seven, and I didn't have to be in court until ten. There was plenty of time to do anything we wanted. Many wrongs could be righted in five hours if we had the right tools....<br><br>"Well, Andrew," I said to him in a high-pitched mournful voice. "I hate to be the one to tell you this...I don't want to hurt you, but -- "<br><br>"No!" he shouted. "Please don't kill me!"<br><br>I seized him quickly by the hair and jerked him off balance. His eyes rolled back in his head and then he went limp. "Stop whining!" I snapped. "I just want to tell you about a <i>legal</i> axiom."<br><br>"Bullshit," he croaked. "You're a goddamn vicious maniac!" He jerked out of my grasp and leaped away, then he braced on the balls of his feet, and bashed me in the stomach with a frenzied right hook. "You bastard!" he screamed. "Get away from me! You're a paranoid psychotic!"<br><br>"We are going to Court, Andrew. We are champions! We will crush them like cheap roaches! TODAY'S PIG IS TOMORROW'S BACON!" I spun suddenly and hurled my green beer bottle so fast across the room that it exploded against the wall like a glass bomb before he even saw it happen. BANG! Whirling like Quisenberry and catching a runner on the nod at second....Fantastic speed and accuracy, no reason at all, but Andrew went crazy with joy and I had to subdue him physically and give him a chance to calm down. It was almost dawn. "Where are the telephones?" I asked him. "Where is a fax machine? We will kill the ones who eat us, and eat the ones we kill!"<br><br>We had no choice.<br><br>I moved quickly for the door, but he stopped me. "Wait a minute," he said. "We're almost out of whiskey."<br><br>He was right. The Old Crow pint was empty except for a few drops down in one corner, and the bars would not open for three hours.<br><br>"Don't worry," he said. "I know where there's more. Upstairs in the president's office."<br><br>"Wonderful," I said. "We can't run out of whiskey at a time like this. Go get it. We'll need everything we can get our hands on, before this thing is over."<br><br>He chuckled and tried to sprint off, but the thing attached to his ankle made him stumble. "Goddamnit!" he screamed. "I'd kill to get rid of this thing!"<br><br>"Don't <i>say</i> that," I snapped. "We are innocent men! We are working within the system...and besides, I think I have some good crank outside in the car."<br><br>He went upstairs to loot the president's office, and I went down those long marble steps, once again, to where my Jeep was parked in front of a fireplug on the street. Hot damn! I thought. This will be a very fast day....<br><br>It was still raining. There was no other sound on the street. Only rain in the elm trees and the fast lazy slap of my brand-new white low-cut Chuck Taylor All-Stars on the sidewalk. I felt like a polar bear, and I wanted to hear some music.<br><br>The big weird Jeep was still there, lurking peacefully under the trees and almost invisible in the mist and the hanging Spanish moss....It was huge, but it had no color. It came from the factory with no paint -- only a dull stainless steel finish that soon faded to a filthy shade of yellow and millions of tiny reddish pits all over the hood and the doors and even the Panzer-style undercarriage.<br><br>"These holes are <i>not rust,"</i> the pompous little factory rep assured me. "What you see here is priceless chemical <i>development</i> that was applied to this vehicle only after fifty-five years of careful research at our secret Color Lab in the Milanese Alps....So you <i>must</i> be patient," he warned. "This process takes <i>time.</i> It involves the slow liberation of Astro-Bacteria, which is frequently <i>lethal</i> to laymen. And which did, in fact, end the life of the tragic genius who first invented it, a man named Squane from Austria."<br><br>Well...maybe so, I figured. It was ugly and pitted all over with millions of festering poison pits, which boiled and bubbled constantly and infected all those who touched it....<br><br>But it was a full-bore Lamborghini hot rod, a monstrous thing that weighed 5,000 pounds with bulletproof glass and twelve cylinders with a top speed of 125 miles an hour and a .50-caliber machine-gun mount behind the driver's seat....One night on the Big Sur Highway I beat a Porsche 928 from the Carmel Bridge to Nepenthe by nine minutes, mainly because I beat her like a cheap hound on the curves. It was a small woman driving the 928 and she went all to pieces when I passed her at 110 on the Bixby Creek Bridge and then squeezed her into the sand dunes....<br><br>Why not? It happened to <i>me</i> once -- in Sacramento, when some Japs in a brute Lamborghini ran me down on The Parkway like I was standing still, then bashed me repeatedly at top speed until I finally lost control....It was one of the ugliest moments of my life and I'll never forget it. Those tattooed swine! I should have had them locked up, but I was helpless.<br><br>After that, I got one of my own, for $150,000.<br><br>But that is another story, and I was too busy that day to even think about it. Dawn was coming up and it was still raining and I had to be in court at 9 o'clock and, ye gods, I still had this freak to deal with -- this gutless zombie with a beeper on his leg who obviously needed help, and somehow I was it.<br><br>How had it happened? I slid into the Lambo and locked the heavy armored door behind me....What dangerous craziness had plunged me into this situation? All I'd wanted to do was hang out in the library for a while and read some Law.<br><br>But somehow I wound up with Andrew on my hands. They had railroaded him into jail for five years, and now I was his only hope. One way or another, I had to get him into a courtroom situation where he'd be able to confront The System on its own mean terms. Put him on the Attack, instead of always on his knees....Right. And we needed to get that goddamn beeping manacle off his leg.<br><br>Indeed. But first things first. Calm down, cool beer, and relax with elegant music...and yes, ah ha, the <i>Crank.</i> Andrew was looking a bit limp, and we would both need special energy for the ordeal I knew was coming....Once I broke him out of jail, as it were, I would be responsible for him until my lawyers took over. They were good, and I felt sure they could get him a new trial. Never mind this <i>jail</i> bullshit. He was innocent. He never had a chance....But no more. The worm had turned. My man Andrew was about to know what it felt like to go into court like a warrior and beat the swine to death with their own rules.<br><br>I felt good about this, very calm and focused as I buried my face in a silver bowl of pure speed and snorted until my whole head went numb and my eyeballs seemed to be fusing together....I punched the music up to 600 watts and felt the Jeep shudder nicely as Lyle Lovett came on....Thank god this thing is soundproof, I thought, or we might have a serious police problem.<br><br>Which is something I like to avoid. But it is getting harder and harder. These are bad times for people who like to sit outside the library at dawn on a rainy morning and get ripped to the tits on crank and powerful music.<br><br>As I walked back to the library I remembered Bobby Kennedy's words: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."<br><br>But not <i>me,</i> Jack.

He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1987&#x2013;88. He lives in Northern California. MICHAEL WILLIAMSON is a photographer for the Washington Post who, in addition to the Pulitzer Prize he shares with Maharidge, won a second Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the war in Kosovo. His other honors include the World Press Photo and Nikon World Understanding Through Photography awards.The collaborative effort of photographer Walker Evans and writer James Agee, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, portrayed the lives of three sharecropper families in the South during the Depression, giving witness to the tyranny of the tenant farming system that enslaved some nine million tenants in 1936. Their book was at once poetic, scathing, compelling, and tragic. Fifty years later, Maharidge and Williamson have revisited, photographed, and interviewed the surviving members and descendants of the Gudger, Ricketts, and Woods families shown in that book. There are so many lives in this saga that it is difficult to keep everyone straight, and the many stories of hardship caused by cotton and the struggle to leave it behind feel less like document than fiction. A fascinating work, nonetheless.<br><i>- Ann Copeland, Drew Univ.

Exhibitions since the 1980s have presented his long career as a chronological sequence. This publication, which will coincide with an exhibition at the British Museum, takes a fresh approach based on innovative scholarship: thematic groupings of late works are related to the major spiritual and artistic quests of Hokusai&#x2019;s life.<br><br> Hokusai&#x2019;s personal beliefs are contemplated here through analyses of major brush paintings, drawings, woodblock prints, and illustrated books. The publication gives due attention to the contribution of Hokusai&#x2019;s daughter Eijo (Oi), also an accomplished artist. Hokusai continually explored the mutability and minutiae of natural phenomena in his art. His late subjects and styles were based on a mastery of eclectic Japanese, Chinese, and European techniques and an encyclopedic knowledge of nature, myth, and history.<br><br><em>Hokusai: beyond the Great Wave</em> draws on the finest collections of his work in Japan and around the world, making this the most important publication for years on Hokusai and a uniquely valuable overview of the artist&#x2019;s late career. 286 illustrations</p><p>Timothy Clark is Head of the Japanese Section in the Department of Asia at the British Museum.</p><h2>The Church Mouse</h2><p>Arthur arranges to have all the mice move to the church to do the cleaning, but his plan is spoiled by Sampson the cat</p><p></p><h2>Praying With the Early Christians: A Year of Daily Prayers and Reflections on the Words of the Early Christians (Praying With the Bible)</h2><p>Using stories from Luke and Acts, this new title in the Praying with the Bible series examines what it meant to be a Christian in the turbulent days following the ministry of Christ and what it means today.

Gibran has his protagonist, called Simply the prophet, deliver spiritual, yet practical homilies on a wide variety of topics central to daily life: love; marriage and children; work and play; possessions; beauty; truth; joy and sorrow; death and many more.</p><p>In a distant, timeless place, a mysterious prophet walks the sands. At the moment of his departure, he wishes to offer the people gifts but possesses nothing. The people gather round, each asks a question of the heart, and the man's wisdom is his gift. It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. On the most basic topics--marriage, children, friendship, work, pleasure--his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired." Free of dogma, free of power structures and metaphysics, consider these poetic, moving aphorisms a 20th-century supplement to all sacred traditions--as millions of other readers already have. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>1 cassette / 90 minutes<br><b>Unabridged</b><p><b>The Prophet</b> is Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece, his most celebrated statement about the truths of the human experience.</p><p>Gibran considered <i>The Prophet</i> to be his greatest achievement.

Posing as principals, they call the local news station and declare a snow day. &#34;All schools are closed!&#34; announces the staff of Croc-O News. &#34;Wheee!&#34; exult Sam, Pam, Will and Jill, a few pages later. &#34;And they sledded and sledded all day.&#34; Lakin&#39;s text is a model of comic economy, using simple vocabulary and repetition to create an ebullient, punchy rhythm. Nash&#39;s gouache-and-pencil pictures, often divided into panels to show simultaneous action among the four protagonists, giddily chronicle the events leading up to the principal ploy: the flurry of phone calls among the friends, the donning of appropriate snow gear, the crushing realization that school presents a formidable obstacle to their sledding.

The shopkeeper had just filled their bowl with a meal of pellets and lined the cage with a fresh sprinkle of aspen shavings and a handful of shredded paper; now the space was clean and almost cozy. Hopper listened as his brother, Pup, burrowed happily into the crisp, new wood curls. Pinkie, their sister, found no such comfort as she clawed at the shiny metal clasp that held the cage lid in place.<br> <br>Pinkie clawed whenever she could. Pinkie was like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Closing time,&#x201d; Keep muttered, humming off-key as he went about his chores. Hopper watched sleepily as beyond the big window, Brooklyn had begun to fade into twilight and shadows.<br> <br>The other mice who shared their cage were already piled into a white-and-brown heap in the corner. Young, and new to the shop, they tired easily. In seconds Hopper could hear the gentle snuffles and sighs of their collective slumber.<br> <br>Keep&#x2019;s gravelly voice rumbled from the back of the shop. &#x201c;Birds . . . check. Felines . . . check. Reptiles and amphibians . . . check, check.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was Keep&#x2019;s end-of-the-day litany&#x2014;checks and reminders and grumbled complaints about ill-smelling feed and dirty cage bottoms. Hopper knew the routine by heart, but he took little joy in the familiarity of it. He hated the darkling hours.<br> <br>Their mother had disappeared at dusk.<br> <br>Now Keep returned to the mouse cage. He gave the clasp a tug to see that it was secure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rodents . . . check.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucky for Keep, he pulled his chubby thumb away just before Pinkie could sink her teeth into it.<br> <br>And that was the last of it. Hopper knew all that remained was for Keep to turn the sign from OPEN to CLOSED. This would inform the patrons on the other side of the big window that there would be no more adoptions today; it was time for the animals to rest. Keep would take his leave, sweeping a chill blast of air into the shop as he opened the door. The bell on the handle would jangle fitfully as the door swung wide; then it would close with a loud, metallic clack as Keep locked it with his key. After that, the shop would fall silent but for the bubbling of the aquariums and the sleepy chirping sounds of animals dreaming of a far-off future in a place called home.<br> <br>But not Hopper. He only ever dreamed one dream. And it was not so much a dream but a memory of his mother on the last day he had ever seen her. It was vague and hazy, but buried deep inside it was the image of her lovely brown face and her twinkling eyes, filled with love.<br> <br>In the memory Hopper and Pinkie and Pup had been no larger than pebbles, pressed against their mother&#x2019;s warm, silken fur. The sun outside the big window had been setting when Keep had approached the cage. And something in Hopper&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s eyes had turned to ice.<br> <br>She knew. Somehow she knew.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Mama?&#x201d; Hopper had asked.<br> <br>Pinkie had been curled around Pup, sound asleep.<br> <br>A creaking sound . . . The cage lid being lifted . . .<br> <br>His mother&#x2019;s heartbeat against him, her eyes glittering with tears as they&#x2019;d darted back and forth between Hopper and Keep. &#x201c;Find the Mews,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d whispered. Her voice, ordinarily sweet and calm and wise, had been frantic. &#x201c;Find the Mews, Hopper. You must.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Keep had had her by the tail, and in the next moment Hopper&#x2019;s mother had been dangling above him, her arms stretching out to him desperately.<br> <br>Hopper had heard her utter a word that might have been &#x201c;below.&#x201d; But he had been too terrified to comprehend. Then she was gone.<br> <br><br> <br>He had watched from sun to sun, seeing the light change the sky outside the big glass, but his mother had not come back.<br> <br>When at last Pinkie had been certain that their mother was lost to them forever, she had turned on him.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t do anything to stop it!&#x201d; she had seethed.<br> <br>&#x201c;What could I have done?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d asked in a small voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Woken me, for starters! I would have known what to do. I would have fought for her.&#x201d;<br> <br>The disdain in her eyes, the scorn in her voice, had caused Hopper to burrow into the aspen shavings in shame.<br> <br>Pup had come and cuddled beside him. Pup had been even tinier then . . . so delicate and fragile. His ears had been smaller and pinker than Hopper&#x2019;s, nearly transparent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Mama went home,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said in his hopeful way. &#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s what happened, Hopper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper had nodded, but there was a lump in his throat. &#x201c;Yes, Pup. That&#x2019;s probably it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we should be happy for her, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper had smiled at his brother but hadn&#x2019;t replied. He had seen his mother&#x2019;s eyes when Keep pinched her tail and jerked her out of their cage. She had not been adopted, brought to a better life. She had been violently stolen. Hopper knew it in his gut. Find the Mews. The phrase haunted him as much as the image did. He still couldn&#x2019;t be certain that&#x2019;s what she&#x2019;d said as she&#x2019;d bobbed above him, her paws reaching for her babies even as the hand pulled her from their lives. But he would never forget the tone of her voice. It was a promise, a warning, a plea . . .<br> <br>Find the Mews.<br> <br>Sometimes in the memory Hopper could almost feel the warmth she&#x2019;d left behind in the nest of paper and wood. She was there and she was gone. And in the dream he could do nothing but watch her go.<br> <br>And always Hopper would awaken with his eyes damp and his heart aching.<br> <br><br> <br>Hopper closed his eyes and listened, first for the whine of the money machine being put to bed, then for the bell on the door that would signal Keep&#x2019;s departure.<br> <br>But the sounds didn&#x2019;t come.<br> <br>Hopper waited.<br> <br>Still no machine. Still no bell.<br> <br>He opened his eyes, his pink nose twitching with awareness. What was Keep waiting for?<br> <br>Suddenly Keep&#x2019;s booted feet stomped across the shop to the counter, and he angrily muttered something under his breath.<br> <br>Curious, Hopper peered through the bars, but all he saw was his own reflection in the glass tank next to his cage.<br> <br>Same old Hopper: small and brown, with a white ring around his right eye; slender paws and long, smooth tail, tapered to a point at the end like a whip. Bright black eyes, and dainty, oval ears, flickering now as he listened to Keep&#x2019;s movements.<br> <br>Coins rattled as the money drawer banged open, then closed again. The machine let out one last long beep and the shop went still.<br> <br>But then the door flung wide&#x2014;the bell jingled madly as the shop was assaulted with a rush of cold wind. A lanky boy wearing a snug woolen cap and a black jacket stood in the doorway. His face was thin and pale, and his eyes narrowed as he locked his gaze on Keep.<br> <br>Worst of all was the long, slithering horrible thing he carried, draped around his neck.<br> <br>Hopper&#x2019;s heart thudded and his blood went cold as one word and one word only trembled on his tongue.<br> <br>Snake!</p><h2>Bunny Busy Day</h2><p>Vintage board book by Cosgrove</p><p></p><h2>Fine Woodworking Design Book Five</h2><p>Fine Woodworking Design Books provide the best work in wood from craftsmen around the world.

Barnum: America&#39;s Greatest Showman</h2><p>If Abraham Lincoln was the great moral force of his age, Phineas Taylor Barnum was its great provider of joy. As one of the earliest practitioners of "the show business," Barnum dedicated his long career to alleviating the &#x201c;severe and drudging practicalness&#x201d; he considered the chief defect of American civilization. His remedy? A prodigious swarm of divas, minstrels, circuses, museums of curiosities, beauty pageants, sideshows, fat-baby and poultry contests &#x2013; whatever it took to entertain his fellow citizens while making him one of his country&#x2019;s first millionaires.<br><br>With P.T. Barnum: America&#x2019;s Greatest Showman, the Messrs Kunhardt rediscover the genius and vision of an unmatched impresario and entrepreneur. In vivid words and spellbinding pictures (more than 500 photographs, engravings, and color lithographs from 41 different archives), we meet a man of complex motives, a master of merchandise, an inveterate self-promoter often reviled for his opportunism. We meet the man who did NOT say "There&#x2019;s a sucker born every minute"; whose best friends were clergymen; whose autobiography sold more than a million copies; who took a public leap through a flaming hoop to prove to the ASPCA that his performing horses were in no danger; who (allegedly) plotted with Samuel Clemens to lease a comet&#x2019;s tail to take a million passengers on a guided tour of outer space. We meet the man who built his reputation &#x2013; and his fortune &#x2013; largely on the exoticism of others, but whose crowning moment as a member of the Connecticut state legislature came in a speech in favor of the constitutional amendment to abolish slavery: "A human soul is not to be trifled with.

In the spring of 1974 Jimmy Breslin went to Washington to observe at first hand the inching along of the cumbersome Watergate investigation process. Breslin did not, however, spend his time in court and committee rooms. He preferred to work the offices on and near Capitol Hill, to talk informally with the congressmen, the lawyers-and their aides-who were laboriously putting together the mountain of paper that was to bury Richard Nixon: he even visited Allenwood Prison in the &#34;businesslike&#34; hills of Pennsylvania. Those names and faces which became so familiar to us in a two-dimensional way last summer are now clad in flesh and sweat.

Although the author never shies away from tough issues in gay life, he focuses on all the delightful permutations of good sex, including a range of exciting positions, many of them photographed for the first time.</p><p>Michael Thomas Ford is the prolific, bestselling author of more than forty books, including the Lambda Literary Award winners <i>Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me</i> and That's <i>Mr. Faggot to You</i>. Ford's first novel, <i>Last Summer</i>, was published this year.This handsomely illustrated and informative gay man's guide to sex offers the perfect marriage... er, civil union... between reassuring, good-humored and consistently engaging text with more than 300 lush, full-color photographs that are explicit but tastefully erotic. Lambda Literary Award-winning humorist Ford (<i>That's Mr. Faggot to You</i> and <i>Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me</i>) enters Dr. Ruth's territory and aces the difficult task of writing a breezy but comprehensive guide that covers everything from gay identity, relationships, health issues and sex play. As a tour guide, Ford is playful (a sidebar on sex toys is called "Dil-Do's and Don'ts") and shockproof ("Rather than seeing kinks as extremes, they should be viewed as different forms of more basic sexual activities") as he explores the good (coming out, building relationships, discovering erogenous zones), the bad (erectile dysfunction, STDs, domestic violence) and the titillating (sensual massage, sexual positions, fetishes). The provocative photos are erotically charged, with the toned, multiethnic models exuding considerable heat in various stages of undress and acrobatics. The vibrant color photographs offer a forthright presentation of male nudity and gay male sexuality that should make this a conversation-starting coffee-table book for same sex households-even those who already know the ins and outs of gay sex. But the more important market for this book may be the uninitiated, who will find in it a thoroughly supportive guide to how adults communicate through, around and about sex. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The talk is lively and fascinating as these leading minds grapple with age-old questions of compelling contemporary urgency. Daniel Goleman, the internationally bestselling author of <b>Emotional Intelligence</b>, provides the illuminating commentary&#x2014;and reports on the breakthrough research this historic gathering inspired.<br><br><b>Destructive Emotions<br><br></b>Buddhist philosophy tells us that all personal unhappiness and interpersonal conflict lie in the &#x201c;three poisons&#x201d;: craving, anger, and delusion. It also provides antidotes of astonishing psychological sophistication--which are now being confirmed by modern neuroscience. With new high-tech devices, scientists can peer inside the brain centers that calm the inner storms of rage and fear. They also can demonstrate that awareness-training strategies such as meditation strengthen emotional stability--and greatly enhance our positive moods.<br><br>The distinguished panel members report these recent findings and debate an exhilarating range of other topics: What role do destructive emotions play in human evolution? Are they &#x201c;hardwired&#x201d; in our bodies? Are they universal, or does culture determine how we feel? How can we nurture the compassion that is also our birthright? We learn how practices that reduce negativity have also been shown to bolster the immune system. Here, too, is an enlightened proposal for a school-based program of social and emotional learning that can help our children increase self-awareness, manage their anger, and become more empathetic.<br><br>Throughout, these provocative ideas are brought to life by the play of personalities, by the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s probing questions, and by his surprising sense of humor. Although there are no easy answers, the dialogues, which are part of a series sponsored by the Mind and Life Institute, chart an ultimately hopeful course. They are sure to spark discussion among educators, religious and political leaders, parents&#x2014;and all people who seek peace for themselves and the world.<br><i>The Mind and Life Institute </i>sponsors cross-cultural dialogues that bring together the Dalai Lama and other Buddhist scholars with Western scientists and philosophers. <i>Mind and Life VIII</i>, on which this book is based, took place in Dharamsala, India, in March 2000.</p><p><i>Destructive Emotions: How Can We Overcome Them? A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama</i> forcefully puts to rest the misconception that the realms of science and spirituality are at odds. In this extraordinary book, Daniel Goleman presents dialogues between the Dalai Lama and a small group of eminent psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers that probe the challenging questions: Can the worlds of science and philosophy work together to recognize destructive emotions such as hatred, craving, and delusion? If so, can they transform those feelings for the ultimate improvement of humanity? As the Dalai Lama explains, "With the ever-growing impact of science on our lives, religion and spirituality have a greater role to play in reminding us of our humanity."<p>The book's subject marks the eighth round in a series of ongoing meetings of the Mind Life Institute. The varied perspectives of science, philosophy, and Eastern and Western thought beautifully illustrate the symbiosis among the views, which are readily accessible despite their complexity. Among the book's many strengths is its organization, which allows readers to enjoy the entire five-day seminar or choose sections that are most relevant to their interests, such as "Cultivating Emotional Balance," "The Neuroscience of Emotion," "Encouraging Compassion," or "The Scientific Study of Consciousness." But the real joy is in gaining an insider's view of these extraordinary minds at work, especially that of the Dalai Lama, whose curiosity, Socratic questioning, and humor ultimately serve as the linchpin for the book's soaring intellectual discussion. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i></p>Daniel Goleman, PH.D. is also the author of the worldwide bestseller <b>Working with Emotional Intelligence </b>and is co-author of <i>Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence,</i> written with Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee. <br><br>Dr. Goleman received his Ph.D. from Harvard and reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for twelve years, where he was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.

She lives in St. Louis, Missouri, with her husband and daughter.</p>McBride's second Debutante Dropout mystery (after <i>Blue Blood</i>) proves as alluring as an Estrada evening dress and as tempting as a slice of death-by-chocolate cake served by the exclusive Dallas Diet Club. The incorrigible Cissy Blevins hasn't given up on restoring daughter Andrea "Andy" Blevins Kendricks, who forsook her debutante season for art school in Chicago and a career as a Webmaster, to her rightful place in society. So when the new TV series <i>The Sweet Life</i>, starring Marilee Mabry, a Texan version of Martha Stewart, has an opening for a Webmaster, Cissy seizes the chance to advance her daughter. With disdain for Dallas high society but an enduring love for her meddlesome mother, Andy serves as the perfect guide to a lifestyle that's the contemporary Texas equivalent of upper-crust Regency. When Andy discovers Marilee's 18-year-old daughter, Kendall, near death on the night of her mother's grand TV debut, the fun really begins. The suspense builds as the do-gooder Webmaster unearths some unpleasant truths about Marilee, Kendall and their shared boy toy and personal trainer, Justin Gable. Though the mystery falters near the end, delicious dishing on social secretaries, Persian rugs and society rags more than compensates. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dull as dishwater. Without rhyme or reason. Leapfrog. Excellent. Gloomy. These words and phrases, so much a part of our daily language, were coined by William Shakespeare more than four hundred years ago. In what other ways has Shakespeare shaped and influenced our words and culture? Find out with Michael Rosen&#x2019;s fascinating exploration of the enduring genius of the greatest playwright in the English language, SHAKESPEARE: HIS WORK AND HIS WORLD. Learn what theatre was like when Shakespeare created and acted in his plays. With dramatic illustrations by Robert Ingpen, the fluid text is sprinkled with Shakespearean quotations to re-create the Bard&#x2019;s world of kings and queens, fairies and potions, and bloody beheadings. This sweeping account is a biography, a history, and a retelling of some of Shakespeare&#x2019;s most famous plays&#x2014;all in one approachable volume.</p><p>Michael Rosen is an award-winning author and anthologist of books for young readers including CLASSIC POETRY: AN ILLUSTRATED COLLECTION, illustrated by Paul Howard. A lifelong Shakespeare fan, Michael Rosen says of this book, "When I was a kid, I was often taken to see Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, and my parents helped me to get hold of what was special about Shakespeare. I&#x2019;ve written this book in hopes that I can do something along the lines of what my parents did for me."<br><br>Robert Ingpen was born in Australia in 1936 and has published more than one hundred acclaimed books. In 1986 he was awarded the highest international accolade for his work, the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for Illustration.Rosen's (Classic Poetry) compelling text and Ingpen's (Who Is the World For?) dramatic paintings invite readers into the "extraordinary and dangerous times" in which the Bard wrote his famous plays. The narrative and design divide into distinct sections ideal for browsing. To set the stage, Rosen introduces "A Plot!" and details how, in 1598, to avoid paying their landlord, actors covertly pulled down the timber from the Curtain theater to reconstruct the Globe (a portion of which Shakespeare owned) on the opposite side of the Thames. Most chapters begin with engaging, chatty rhetorical questions (relayed, however, in a sometimes distracting typeface) such as "What's So Special About Shakespeare?" and "So How Does Someone Stay That Famous?" Some metaphors, such as comparing Shakespeare's plays to a "house full of many amazing rooms," become a bit strained, but the narrative benefits from liberal quotation of Shakespeare's plays. Rosen effectively sets the historical context and reconstructs and imagines the events and circumstances of Shakespeare's life, while also demonstrating the surprising and pervasive extent of his linguistic legacy. Ingpen's atmospheric paintings evoke the romance of the era and capture the pageantry of the plays. A strong and worthy companion for readers exploring Shakespeare.

This authoritative and eloquent book coaxes the wolf out from its camouflage of myth and reveals the depth of its kinship with humanity, which shares this animal&#39;s complex complex social organization, intense family ties, and predatory streak.</p><p>They have been feared, sentimentalized, and slaughtered, yet they somehow have managed to resist extinction. Now wolves are being reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park, reawakening passions as ancient as their tangled relationship with human beings. For wolves, says Peter Steinhart, are our secret sharers, fellow predators with a complex social organization, intense family ties, and an equal capacity for aggression and cooperation. In The Company of Wolves, Steinhart follows these elusive creatures into their natural habitats. He describes the complexities of predation and pack life. He listens to them howl. He talks to the men and women who have devoted their lives to protecting or eradicating them.

This autobiographical bildungsroman brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Marilyn (then called Brian) felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to "date." Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christian Right loves to hate. Best of all, Manson is shockingly honest, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, over-sensitive, ignoble, and, mostly, highly fallible and human. It's a long way from the auto-hagiographies that other stars have written, and it's easily one of the best reads in celebrity bio. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i><p>The best-selling autobiography of America&#x2019;s most controversial celebrity icon, Marilyn Manson (with a bonus chapter not in the hardcover).</p><p>In his twenty-nine years, rock idol Manson has experienced more than most people have (or would want to) in a lifetime.

As the story begins, he's just blown the head off his wife with the Mannlicher carbine she kept strapped to her wheelchair. The murder and the bizarre life that led to it are the subject of a mass of hearsay related by an unnamed life-insurance salesman in a narrative as mazy, byzantine, and mysterious as the lime works, Konrad's sanctuary and tomb.<br><br>"A masterfully dense set of esthetic, social and political metaphors about contemporary life, about art, about obsessive commitment to anything....The book is a jungle of meaning, the opposite of simplistic allegory, and a major achievement."&#x2014;William Kennedy, <i>The New Republic</i></p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-89) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother..... when Konrad bought the lime works, about five and a half years ago, the first thing he moved in was a piano he set up in his room on the first floor, according to the gossip at the Laska tavern, not because of any artistic leanings, says Wieser, the manager of the Mussner estate, but for relaxation, to ease the nervous strain caused by decades of unremitting brain work, says Fro, the man in charge of the Trattner estate, agreeing that Konrad's piano playing had nothing to do with art, which Konrad hates, but was just improvisation, as Wieser says, for an hour first thing early in the morning and another late at night, every day, spent at the keyboard, with the metronome ticking away, the windows open ...<br><br>... next, Konrad bought a lot of guns, partly from fear but also because he had a passion for firearms, second-hand rifles mostly but in prime working order, from the estate of Forestry Commissioner Ulrich who died last year, well-known makes like the Mannlicher etc., which Konrad, an extremely shy man (Wieser), full of apprehension that tended to grow into panic ever since the landowners Mussner and Trattner were mysteriously murdered not so long ago, felt he needed to protect the lime works against burglars and in general against what he called outsiders ...<br><br>... Konrad's wife, whose maiden name was Zryd, a woman almost totally crippled by decades of taking the wrong medications, and who had consequently spent half her lifetime hunched over in her custom-built French invalid chair, but who is now, as Wieser puts it, out of her misery, was taught by Konrad how to use a Mannlicher carbine, a weapon the otherwise defenseless woman kept out of sight but always within reach, with the safety off, behind her chair, and it was with this gun that Konrad killed her on the night of December 24-25, with two shots in the back of the head (Fro); two shots in the temple (Wieser); abruptly (Fro) putting an end to their marital hell (Wieser). Konrad had always been quick to fire at anything within range of the house, they say at Laska's, and as everyone knows he did shoot the woodcutter and game keeper Koller who was passing by on his way home from work one evening about four and a half years ago; quite soon after Konrad had moved in, carrying his knapsack and a hoe, and catching it in the left shoulder because Konrad mistook him for a burglar; for which shooting Konrad was in due course sentenced to nine and a half months at hard labor. The incident brought to light about fifteen previous convictions of Konrad's, mostly for libel and aggravated assault, they say at Laska's. Konrad served his time in the Wels district prison, where he is being held again right now ...<br><br>. . . apart from the exceptional few who found his eccentric though quite inconspicuous personality interesting, people began little by little to cut him dead; even those who wanted his money preferred to have nothing to do with him. When I myself ran into him a few times on the road to Lambach, or Kirchham, and a couple of times walking through the high timber forest, he'd nail me every time by starting to talk without let-up on some topic of a medical or political or scientific kind, or a mixture of all three; more about that later ...<br><br>... at Lanner's the word is that Konrad killed his wife with two shots; at the Stiegler place, with a single shot; at The Inglenook, with three; and at Laska's with several shots. Obviously nobody really knows except, presumably, the police experts, how many times Konrad pulled that trigger ...<br><br>... but the trial, set for the 15th, should cast some light-even if only in the legal sense, as Wieser says-on the mystery of this shooting, a mystery that only gets darker as time goes on ...<br><br>... despite what most people thought even as recently as last January-that Konrad gave himself up right after the alleged bloody deed-it is now known that he did nothing of the kind. At Laska's, w'here I managed yesterday to sell no less than three new life insurance policies, they are saying that it took the police two whole days to find him at long last in the frozen manure pit behind the lime works. The story is that the police were called by the so-called handyman, Hoeller, because of the strange prolonged silence in the house, and when they broke in they found the murdered woman slumped in her chair but no trace of her husband, whom the evidence promptly led them to identify as the killer. They combed the whole building from top to bottom several times, then they searched the annex where Hoeller lives, and all the other structures on the grounds, the nearby woods, everything, without success. Not until the next day, when it occurred to Reserve Officer Moritz to lift up the rotting planks covering the manure pit, was Konrad discovered, cowering half-frozen underneath; he was arrested and taken without the least resistance on his part, exhausted as he understandably was, straight to the room at the lime works where the murder had occurred and where at this point an old straw mattress dragged down from the attic was doing duty for the corpse in the chair. Even though the police let Konrad change before starting to grill him, they kept rushing him in their anxiety to get him to Wels as quickly as possible, I am told. Only after Konrad showed them some full bottles of liquor he had in the room and encouraged them to drink it all, did they suddenly relax and begin to take their time. The drinks were just what they needed after all the bother of looking for Konrad, and those men reputedly emptied the four or five or maybe even six bottles of schnapps in the patrol wagon, though to gain the necessary time they chose a detour of about sixty or seventy miles, crossing the Krems River right after they passed Sicking, so that it took them two and a half hours from Sicking to Wels, a distance that ordinarily takes less than half an hour-two and a half hours! And when they finally got there, Konrad actually came tumbling out of the wagon head first; with his handcuffs on he could not hold on to anything and maybe one of the officers pushed him a little, and him without any shoes on, all he had on his feet was a pair of felt socks, they say, because the police were in too big a hurry to give him a chance to put on a pair of clean shoes; as for the shoes he had on when they dragged him from the manure pit, they were so bloated with liquid manure that once he'd dragged them off his feet he couldn't possibly have gotten into them again, and they wouldn't give him time to get a fresh pair from his own room; it was, Wieser said, inhuman. And Fro says that Konrad should never have been taken on that ride in the freezing cold without something to cover his head, Konrad being of an age when the slightest chill can have the most devastating effect; why, a draft to the back of the head has been known to cause death! but, on the other hand, considering the monstrous crime he committed, and more particularly that he survived two days and even the grueling night-time cold in that manure pit without coming to serious harm, it would be absurd to make a fuss over such trivia as the missing shoes, when he was at least back in dry, relatively warm clothing. They do say that Konrad asked for his long leather pants that he said were the best protection he had against catching cold, but Reservist Moritz who went to Konrad's room for his things paid no attention and reappeared with an ordinary pair of dark gray loden pants, also a loden jacket, which he tossed on the floor at Konrad's feet along with some underwear, a shirt, the aforementioned felt socks, and a handkerchief, ordering him to dress and be quick about it. Officer Halbeis who meanwhile was using his rifle butt to keep Konrad pinned in the corner near the desk, Fro says, as if the totally defenseless and wholly apathetic prisoner was likely to offer any resistance, is reported to have said "murderer" repeatedly to Konrad, whereupon the county magistrate, who, on entering the room, heard Halbeis using the word murderer is said to have pointed out that it was not for the police to call Konrad a murderer at this stage of the proceedings. Nevertheless the police disregarded what Wieser calls the magistrate's highly proper instructions and continued to call Konrad a murderer in the presence of the magistrate who, it seems, did not notice that the policemen went on calling Konrad a murderer despite his explicit warning. Reservist Moritz, incidentally, is said to have acted quite against regulations when he pulled the Konrad woman's body upright in the chair where it lay slumped forward, with her head all ripped to pieces from the shot or shots from that carbine; he did it, supposedly, after Police Inspector Neuner had briefly left the room in order, Wieser guessed, to find out some detail from Hoeller, the man who knew the lime works better than anyone else and who happened to be in the downstairs vestibule just then; it must have been right after the body was discovered, and the reason Moritz straightened it out was that he was afraid its own shifting weight would send it suddenly slipping from the chair onto the wooden floor. But the magistrate, referring to this in passing, called Moritz a bungling amateur, Fro says. Editor Lanik of the local paper, one of the rottenest characters around, is said to have been refused admittance to the lime works altogether. Wieser also mentions the shattered wrist on the corpse, proof that she had her hands up in front of her face when the shot fell. Fro keeps using the word unrecognizable, over and over again he says streaming with blood ...<br><br>. . . at Laska's they say that Konrad had tried at first to drag the corpse out to the upstairs vestibule, which has a window overlooking the water; like every man who has just killed someone, Konrad thought, says Wieser, that he could get rid of the victim, and the first thing that naturally occurred to him was to drag the body to that window and then, after weighting it with some good-sized object of iron or stone, as Fro thinks, simply drop it out the window where there happened to be, right under the sill, two marble blocks intended as door posts but left unused by Hoerhager, Konrad's cousin and the former owner of the lime works, who had decided to use tuffstone instead; Fro feels sure that those two marble blocks will playa part in the course of the trial. Anyway Konrad soon realized that he could not drag the body to the window overlooking the water, because he simply did not have the strength, besides which it may have dawned on him that it would not make sense to throw the body into the water that way, because even a medium-bright flatfoot would soon have seen through so clumsy a way to dispose of the victim, as Wieser says; malefactors always began by thinking up the craziest ways to cover their tracks, and what could have been crazier in this case than to toss the Konrad woman out the window. So when Konrad had dragged her about midway he gave up the idea, possibly he decided at that point not to get rid of the body at all is Fro's guess, but in any case he dragged it right back, the blood pouring from it harder all the time, dragged it all the way back to her room and somehow he mustered the strength to prop her up in her chair again, as the police reconstructed what happened; they say Konrad admitted that his dead wife kept slipping through his arms to the wooden floor as he tried to get her back into the chair, it took him over an hour to get the heavy, lifeless woman's body that kept slipping down on him back into that chair. When he finally made it he was so exhausted that he broke down beside the chair ...<br><br>. . . immediately after the murder, he is alleged to have told them, he began to run around inside the lime works as if he had gone completely crazy, he ran around from top to bottom and back again, and it was when he finally stopped to lean on the window seat overlooking the water in the upstairs vestibule, that it occurred to him to throw the dead woman out that window into the water. In fact there were blood tracks throughout the lime works that show exactly where and how Konrad ran allover the place, his statements, easy enough to check, were true, and Fro believes that Konrad had no reason not to tell the truth, actually it was characteristic of Konrad to be a fanatic about telling the truth, and still is. At The Inglenook they were saying that Konrad shot the woman in cold blood from behind, made sure she was dead, and then instantly went to give himself up. At Laska's the word was that the woman's head was shattered by a bullet fired into her left temple. When they're discussing which temple it was, some keep saying it was the left temple and others that it was the right temple. At Lanner's there were some who said that Konrad had killed his wife with an ax and then shot her with the carbine only after she was already dead, plain evidence of insanity. At Laska's they said that Konrad held the muzzle of the gun to the back of his wife's head and did not pull the trigger for a minute or two, so she knew when she felt the gun at her head that he was going to do her in this time, but made no move to defend herself. Probably he shot her at her own request, they say at the Stiegler, her life was hell and getting more agonizing every day, and it was just as well that the poor soul-which is the way people almost always referred to her everywhere-was out of it. Still, they do say that Konrad should have shot himself after shooting his wife, because all he had to look forward to now was the inescapable horror of prison or else the madhouse for life ...</p><h2>Elfquest: The Grand Quest - VOL 01</h2><p>A grand saga follows the adventures of human, trolls, and various elfin tribes.</p><p></p><h2>Harriet Spies Again (Companion to Harriet the Spy)</h2><p>Harriet M. Welsch has just received the best news of her eleventh year&#x2014;Ole Golly is coming back! Harriet can still remember how sad she was when her beloved nanny married George Waldenstein and moved away. But the circumstances of Ole Golly&#x2019;s return remain unclear. Where is George Waldenstein?<br> <br>With Mr. and Mrs. Welsch living in France for three months, Sport confiding that he has a crush on a girl at school, and the arrival of a mysterious new neighbor, who&#x2019;s going to require a whole lot of spying, Harriet already has her hands full. Then she overhears Ole Golly saying she&#x2019;s innocent&#x2014;but innocent of <i>what</i>? Harriet the Spy is on the case and ready to help Ole Golly in any way she can.</p><p>Purists may shudder, but Harriet the Spy is back--even though her original creator, Louise Fitzhugh, is long gone. Author Helen Ericson has developed an intriguing new episode in Harriet's life for her latest fans, many of whom were introduced to <i>Harriet the Spy</i>--the book--only after the movie. When Harriet's former nurse, Ole Golly (who went off to live in Montreal last year after getting married to Mr. George Waldenstein), temporarily returns to her old post in the Welsch household, Harriet is deliriously happy. Unfortunately, Ole Golly is not acting like her brisk, no-nonsense self at all, and Harriet has been instructed to "expunge" the husband from her memory. What's up? This looks like a job for our girl sleuth extraordinaire! Side plots involving Harriet's friend Sport's impending puberty and a mysterious new neighbor keep things moving along at a rapid pace, but there's no denying it: it's just not the same. Ericson captures much of Harriet's essence, but she seems to be trying too hard. And the denouement (fairly easy to figure out early on) is downright odd. Still, for those who are hungering for more Harriet, this taste serves as a nice little snack. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>&#x201c;Ericson has perfectly captured the voice and pacing of Fitzhugh&#x2019;s original novel in a seamless rendering of a fresh, enjoyable story for today&#x2019;s readers.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Emma&#39;s War: An aid worker, a warlord, radical Islam, and the politics of oil--a true story of love and death in Sudan</h2><p>Emma McCune&#x2019;s passion for Africa, her unstinting commitment to the children of Sudan, and her youthful beauty and glamour set her apart from other relief workers from the moment she arrived in southern Sudan. But no one was prepared for her decision to marry a local warlord&#x2014;a man who seemed to embody everything she was working against&#x2014;and to throw herself into his violent quest to take over southern Sudan&#x2019;s rebel movement.<br><br>With precision and insight, Deborah Scroggins&#x2014;who met McCune in Sudan&#x2014;charts the process by which McCune&#x2019;s romantic delusions led to her descent into the hell of Africa&#x2019;s longest-running civil war. Emma&#x2019;s War is at once a disturbing love story and an up-close look at Sudan: a world where international aid fuels armies as well as the starving population, and where the northern-based Islamic government&#x2014;backed by Osama bin Laden&#x2014;is locked in a war with the Christian and pagan south over religion, oil, and slaves.<br><br>A timely, revelatory account of the nature of relief work, of the men and women who choose to carry it out, and of one woman&#x2019;s sacrifice to its ideals.</p><p>&#x201c;[A] brilliantly penetrating portrait...McCune, who came to Sudan in 1987 as a 23-year-old British aid worker and married a Sudanese rebel commander, is only among the latest in a long line of adventuring moralists. In her, Scroggins has found a feckless, captivating subject, as insufferable as the white man&#x2019;s insatiable need for redemption in Africa...Scroggins uses McCune&#x2019;s story to illuminate much more than her subject&#x2019;s erotic and humanitarian escapades...After reading this powerful book, I find her fury contagious.&#x201d; &#x2013;Lorraine Adams, <i>Washington Post Book World<b><br></b></i><br>"[A] compelling portrait of an independent-minded British aid worker who married a Sudanese warlord...Scroggins uses the story of Emma McCune, a young woman with fashion-model looks who found something in African culture missing from her own life, as a through-line to follow the neglected history of Africa in the 1980s and '90s...Once in Sudan, [Emma] proved herself a diligent and charismatic figure, eschewing white privileges, behaving at times more Sudanese than Western, and developing a cult-like following...Solid background, cinematic descriptions, and the author's own intimate knowledge of the Sudan and the international aid community in Africa enhance this profile of a woman who gave herself fully to her ideals, and to her fate."<br>&#x2013;<i>Kirkus</i><b><br></b><br>"This is an important book. Scroggins quietly sets down the catalog of horrors - the perpetual violation of one culture by another, and the wretched populations left on the bloodied field without safety or self-sufficiency. What is considered somehow 'a black thing,' 'an African thing,' is just a sad parody of the worst of colonialism: greed, corruption, anarchy and violence. What I admired above all is Scroggins's ability to both think and write, superbly well, about not only the deep complexities of Sudan and its neighbors, but also about the eternal ethnic and religious disputes that have now landed right on our doorstep. EMMA'S WAR should be read not only for its fascinating historical roadmaps, but its furious recital of our narcissistic fantasies of making the black, the other, white in our image.

Reprint. 30,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Andrew Robinson</b> is the literary editor of <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>.Preface<p><b>Preface</b></p><p>Versatile people have always fascinated me as a biographer. Most recently, there was Albert Einstein, who, as everyone knows, fathered diverse new fields of science, but who also influenced some crucial areas of international politics. Before Einstein, Michael Ventris, a professional architect who in his spare time deciphered Linear B, the earliest European writing system, and became revered by archaeologists. And before Ventris, two prodigious Indians, the writer Rabindranath Tagore and the filmmaker Satyajit Ray, both of whom were intensely creative in areas outside literature and cinema. </p><p>But I must admit that Thomas Young (1773-1829), for sheer range of expertise, beats them all. Not only did he make pioneering contributions to physics (the wave theory of light) and engineering (the modulus of elasticity), to physiology (the mechanism of vision) and to Egyptology (the decipherment of the hieroglyphs), but he was also a distinguished physician, a major scholar of ancient Greek, a phenomenal linguist, and an authoritative writer on all manner of other subjects, from carpentry and music to life insurance and ocean tides. In an exhibition on Young arranged by London's Science Museum for his bicentenary in 1973, the organizers went so far as to state: "Young probably had a wider range of creative learning than any other Englishman in history. He made discoveries in nearly every field he studied". </p><p>This makes Young a tough subject for a biographer, and perhaps that is why there has not been a new biography of him for half a century. I have contemplated writing one for over a decade, since first encountering Young while researching a book, <i>The Story of Writing</i>, and I became further committed to the idea while writing another book, <i>Lost Languages</i>, on archaeological decipherment, a few years later. But having thought about the challenge, I decided it would be better to write an introduction to Young for a new audience, rather than attempting a full biography. To cover his work and life in detail and with authority is probably impossible for a single writer. This book therefore dwells only on the highlights of his polymathic career, though it aims to touch on every interesting and enduring aspect of Young.</p><p>I should like to thank the following for their help. Nicholas Wade, professor of visual psychology at Dundee, procured for me a four-volume set of the recent facsimile edition of Young's most famous work, <i>A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts</i>, for which he wrote an introduction. Christina Riggs, curator of Egyptology at the Manchester Museum, advised me on Horapollo's hieroglyphs. David Sprigings, consultant cardiologist at Northampton General Hospital, encouraged me to trace the post-mortem examination of Young to the library of St George's Hospital, London (where Young was a physician), and provided an expert opinion on the cause of his early death. Simon Young, son of the physiologist J. Z. Young, and great-great-great-grandnephew of Thomas Young, kindly gave me permission to reproduce his copy of the portrait of his ancestor painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence. Finally, I am grateful to my publisher, Stephen Morrow, at Pi Press, for getting excited by Young's versatility, too.</p><p><b>London, September 2005</b></p><br><p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

But every place has its secrets and beneath the calm surface lurk hidden resentments and dangerous passions. When a man is found lying face down in a nearby watersplash, the verdict is death by misadventure. But Miss Silver happens to be in the neighbourhood and she suspects foul play...</p><p>Patricia Wentworth was born in India and after writing several romances turned her hand to crime. She wrote dozens of bestselling mysteries before her death in the late Sixties, and was recognised as one of the mistresses of classic crime.The watersplash turns into a deadly site in the quaint British village of Greenings in this cozy classic. Foul play, woven inextricably with greed, passion, and resentment, results in brutal violence, tainting the village&#39;s sweet harmony. Maud Silver lights upon the scene to investigate the deaths in her subtle yet penetrating way, which is ever so reminiscent of Agatha Christie&#39;s Miss Marple. Diana Bishop embodies each of the Greenings residents&#39; voices with clarity and a refined enunciation that translates well for both the old-timers and the youth. Bishop grasps the confidential tones inherent in vehement gossip, as well as the diverse personalities of the range of suspects and innocents.

I was in the first grade at a Catholic school in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The pastor of our church made the first of his weekly visits to our classroom that Friday morning.<br> <br>We all sat in awe of this very stern-looking old guy dressed in a long black robe with a bright red cape, holding a leather-bound Bible, its pages trimmed with gold leaf. We were all afraid. For all we knew, God could strike us dead if we didn&#x2019;t listen and behave. (Yes, I am a recovering &#x201c;Cathaholic.&#x201d;)<br> <br>Switching back and forth between French and English, he talked about heaven. That was nice. And he talked about hell&#x2014;definitely not nice. He told us how if we were not very, very careful, and if we did not do exactly as we were told, we would all end up in that terrible place forever! Then he read from the book of Genesis and told us how: &#x201c;God took the dust of the earth and formed the body of man; and breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#x201d;<br> <br>To say that those words made an impression on me would be a huge understatement. I was smitten! I began to feel uncontrollable and unimaginable excitement at the thought that God was breathing into me. It was the most amazing thing I had ever heard, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand why everyone else wasn&#x2019;t excited about it like me.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t sit still. I couldn&#x2019;t shut up. I think I was in a state of rapture. I know I became too animated, and I guess I disrupted the class, because I remember the monsignor&#x2019;s hands on my shoulders: he was forcing me to sit back down in my chair.<br> <br>Either because of him or in spite of him, something in me was definitely awakened that day. I sensed there was something magical, mystical, something wonderful and beautiful about breathing, and no amount of guilt, fear, force, shame, or cajoling was going to change or erase it. This was the spark that lit a fire in me, and to this day, I remain utterly fascinated&#x2014;more than ever in fact&#x2014;with breath and breathing, and with the power and potential of breathwork.<br> <br>From that moment of revelation, my personal path of breathwork took me on an incredible adventure from an X-ray technology program in Boston, and then into the US Navy during the Vietnam War era as an independent hospital corpsman, deep-sea diver, and emergency rescue specialist. I trained CPR and first-aid instructors, EMTs, and other emergency responders; developed the first stress and coping program for the American Red Cross; and designed a master&#x2019;s program called &#x201c;The Breath as a Tool for Health, Growth, and Change&#x201d; at Lesley University in Cambridge.<br> <br>Breathing training led me to study in India with yogi masters; to the Academy of Chinese Medicine in Beijing; and to the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. I&#x2019;ve learned methods of breathing from Zen Buddhism, from Rebirthing with Leonard Orr, from Holotropic Breathwork with Stan Grof, and other sources.<br> <br>Recently, breathwork led me to Silicon Valley, to the Nissan-Renault Group&#x2019;s Research Labs. This automaker developed a prototype of a car that integrates a breathing feature into the driver&#x2019;s and passenger&#x2019;s seats. A mechanism in the seat, taken from Innovzen&#x2019;s O2 Chair, moves in a way that promotes and supports full, relaxed breathing. It was an honor to present and fun to demonstrate the concept of &#x201c;onboard breathing&#x201d; to the CEO and his team. In the next few years as self-driving cars hit the highways, we&#x2019;ll have more free time to focus on other things, like energizing and relaxing ourselves on the way to and from work.<br> <br>All of these experiences have been the deep well where I&#x2019;ve drawn from many different schools and styles of breathing to create a unique and diverse program for breathing training. That&#x2019;s why my martial artist friends call me &#x201c;the Bruce Lee of breathwork.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m like Bruce Lee, but one trait we do have in common is the willingness to think outside the box and uncover every stone&#x2014;to share the best from all of our teachers&#x2014;and the dedication and dream to teach what we have learned to anyone ready and willing to do the work.<br> What Is Breathwork?<p></p> <br>Breathwork is the use of Breath Awareness and Conscious Breathing for healing and growth, personal awakening, and transformation in spirit, mind, and body. All the breathing techniques you&#x2019;ll learn in this book have this definition at their core. Breathwork falls into the field of self-improvement and personal development. It is a self-help, self-healing method in alternative medicine. It is also a key to spiritual purification and self-mastery. It is the most holistic and complementary approach to health care, and it is an essential part of any genuine spiritual development program.<br> <br>Here is a partial list of settings and situations where breathwork is now being taught and applied, courtesy of Dr. Peter Litchfield (President of the Graduate School of Behavioral Health Services):<br> <br>Alternative Health Care<br> <br>Anger Management<br> <br>Athletic Coaching<br> <br>Attention Training<br> <br>Biofeedback<br> <br>Bodywork<br> <br>Childbirth<br> <br>Chiropractic<br> <br>Corporate Training<br> <br>Counseling<br> <br>Dentistry<br> <br>Drug Abuse Prevention<br> <br>Drug Rehabilitation<br> <br>Education (all levels)<br> <br>Fitness Training<br> <br>Flight Training (aviation)<br> <br>Martial Arts<br> <br>Medicine<br> <br>Meditation<br> <br>Midwifery<br> <br>Military Training<br> <br>Neurofeedback<br> <br>Nursing<br> <br>Occupational Therapy<br> <br>Orthodontics<br> <br>Pain Management<br> <br>Peak Performance Training<br> <br>Performing Arts<br> <br>Personal Coaching<br> <br>Physical Therapy<br> <br>Psychology<br> <br>Public Speaking<br> <br>Respiratory Therapy<br> <br>Self-regulation Learning<br> <br>Skill Acquisition<br> <br>Social Work<br> <br>Speech Therapy<br> <br>Stress Management<br> <br>Test Taking<br> <br>Trauma and PTSD<br> <br>Yoga<br> <br>Zen<br> <br>More and more people are waking up to the incredible value of breathwork, and they are applying it in their everyday lives at work and at home. Coaches, health-care professionals, counselors, trainers, teachers, and therapists are using it to create breakthroughs for themselves and for those they serve. For spiritual seekers, it&#x2019;s a direct path to spiritual awakening, self-realization, and enlightenment. That&#x2019;s why breathwork is a major skill set that high-performing and successful individuals have mastered&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the secret ingredient that puts them exactly where they want to be.<br> <br>I teach breathwork as a formula for personal transformation in which three basic skills or elements are taught:<br> <br>Awareness (the consciousness factor): The message is &#x201c;wake up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Relaxation (the release factor): The message is &#x201c;let go!&#x201d;<br> <br>Breathing (the energy factor): The message is &#x201c;take charge!&#x201d;<br> <br>I have found that no matter what method is used, or what label is given to it, every miracle event; every healing experience; every positive shift, emotional release, or behavioral change&#x2014;every bit of growth can be linked to one of these three elements. Real power and magic comes from blending them and simultaneously engaging in these three elements deliberately and consistently. In practice we increase, expand, and refine our awareness. We use the breath to relax more quickly and deeply, and in more situations. And we learn breath control that results in more energy and aliveness, comfort and pleasure, and personal power and resilience.<br> <br>I also call what I do breath therapy, which is based on two key ideas:<br> <br>1. The breathing system in most people is not functioning at an optimal level. We need to heal it. We need to improve or restore our breathing capacity, to correct any dysfunctional habits or patterns that inhibit or interfere with the free expression our true nature and full potential.<br> <br>2. Once our breathing is full and free, healthy and natural, once it is restored or raised to an optimal level, then it automatically becomes a therapeutic tool. The body and breath can be used to heal the mind, and the mind and breath can be used to heal the body. Breathwork can be used to heal attitudes, emotions, and behaviors.<br> <br>There are five principles of breath therapy. These principles came about as I searched for the answer to this question: &#x201c;Why do dramatic positive results&#x2014;even miracles&#x2014;happen as a result of breathing sessions, and not in other kinds of therapeutic sessions?&#x201d; The answer to that lies in the application of these five principles:<br> <br>1. The technique (there are many techniques, each with a certain purpose or effect).<br> <br>2. The atmosphere in which one practices (physical/psychological/emotional/energetic).<br> <br>3. The teacher (making use of the &#x201c;power and purity of our personal presence&#x201d;).<br> <br>4. The mind of the breather (thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, intentions, desires, will).<br> <br>5. The &#x201c;something else&#x201d; (a mystical or magical factor: luck, grace, timing, readiness).<br> BREATHE NOW: HOW ARE YOU BREATHING?<p></p> <br>Let&#x2019;s try a quick exercise.<br> <br>A healthy person should be able to breathe both low in the belly, as well as high in the chest, easily and at will. You should be able to breathe slowly: two or three breaths per minute. And you should be able to breathe quickly: sixty or even 120 breaths per minute. When sitting at rest, your breathing should be low and slow.<br> <br>How are you breathing? Observe and sense your breathing right now.<br> <br>Put one hand over your belly and one hand over the center of your chest, and monitor your breathing. How does it feel to breathe? What moves when you breathe? Where does the breath go? Are you a chest breather? A belly breather? Is your breathing fast and shallow, or is it slow and deep? Is it smooth and regular, or choppy and chaotic? Are there pauses in the breathing?<br> <br>As with any art or skill, the key to excellence or greatness is in understanding and applying the fundamentals. Even the world&#x2019;s greatest musicians practice the scales before a performance. You will go a lot further and a lot faster if you start with the basics and keep returning to them. When it comes to breathwork, there are two basic aspects: Breath Awareness and Conscious Breathing. You can think of these as yin and yang, active and passive aspects of the practice.<br> Breath Awareness: Being the Breath<p></p> <br>Breath Awareness means paying close attention to the breath as you allow it to come and go on its own, by itself. The idea is to simply observe your breathing, watch the breath, witness it. No need to breathe in any particular way. This is the passive aspect. It is the practice of pure awareness applied to breathing.<br> <br>The awareness we are talking about is meditative awareness. It is not thinking, not judging, not comparing, not analyzing; you are not trying to figure out anything or do anything right. In fact, Breath Awareness is not really something you &#x201c;do.&#x201d; We are talking about a soft, open state of alertness and presence. Breath Awareness is a mindfulness practice. I also call it &#x201c;breath watching.&#x201d; In fact I use the terms interchangeably. It is attention training. All you need to do is decide to focus on your breathing and to observe it, sense it, moment to moment.<br> BREATHE NOW: SENSE YOUR BREATHING<p></p> <br>Bring your attention to the breath. Focus on your breathing. Sense your breathing. Observe it, listen to it, feel it. Witness it. How do you know you are breathing? What feelings and sensations tell you that you are breathing? Where do those feelings and sensations occur? Where does the breath go when it flows into you? What does it touch? What moves when you breathe? What muscles do you use?<br> <br>As you become more aware of the breath, you naturally become more aware of other things occurring in your mind and body: thoughts and images, feelings and sensations, perceptions and emotions. You may become more aware of your physical tensions, energetic contractions, habits, patterns, urges, reactions, and inner dialogue.<br> <br>A very important part of Breath Awareness is simply to witness these various phenomena; notice them without judging, resisting, or attaching to them. If you get distracted by these things, or if your mind wanders off on a tangent, no problem, just return your attention to your breathing and fully focus on the next breath. Look for details in the breathing that perhaps you have never noticed before.<br> <br>With practice, you will naturally move toward a place of freedom and inner peace, and the realization that nothing is happening to you: it is simply happening! You will develop a natural ease and a greater sense of aliveness. Ultimately you will realize that you are always and already free, no matter what you think or how you feel.<br> <br>Because of the power and potential of this fundamental practice, we are going to spend a lot of time on it, and we&#x2019;ll keep coming back to it, especially in chapter 4, &#x201c;Breathing to Transform Your Spirit.&#x201d;<br> Conscious Breathing: Doing the Breathing<p></p> <br>The second basic aspect of breathwork is Conscious Breathing. This is where you come in. You are an active participant in the breathing process, more than the witness. Conscious Breathing means that you deliberately control, direct, and regulate the breathing in some way. You give the breathing a certain quality or a specific pattern. You breathe with a conscious intention. You are creative.<br> <br>With Breath Awareness, the breath breathes you; with Conscious Breathing, you breathe the breath.<br> <br>An example of a Conscious Breathing exercise is to breathe at a rate of four to eight breaths per minute, which is considered to be a &#x201c;therapeutic zone&#x201d; since it has so many naturally therapeutic benefits. So let&#x2019;s begin with an average of six breaths per minute. That means a five-second inhale and a five second exhale.<br> BREATHE NOW: REGULATE YOUR BREATHING<p></p> <br>Breathe in for a count of five seconds, and breathe out for a count of five seconds. Spend some time settling in to this rhythm. Make your breathing pattern smooth and steady, inhaling for five seconds and exhaling for five seconds. Simple isn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br>Start by focusing on your breathing. At first simply being aware of it, observe it, then begin to gently bring it under your conscious control. Let the breaths be smooth and steady and rhythmic, inhaling for five seconds and exhaling for five seconds:<br> <br>Inhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Inhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>How do you feel after a few minutes of this practice? If you find it difficult to breathe that slowly, then use a count of two or three or four to start. Or just count faster!<br> <br>If this rhythm is quite easy, experiment with a count of eight, ten, or twelve, or count more slowly. In any case, don&#x2019;t push, don&#x2019;t force, don&#x2019;t stress, or strain. Relax. Be patient with yourself as you practice.<br> <br>We will play with many other Conscious Breathing exercises and techniques in the coming chapters, but start with this one to begin a daily practice. Do it first thing in the morning, do it at lunchtime, and do it again before bed. Do it if you find yourself becoming tense or upset, or scattered in your thinking. Remember to:<br> <br>Inhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Inhale, ...</p><h2>Sugar: A Global History (Edible)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s no surprise that sugar has been on our minds for millennia. First cultivated in New Guinea around 8,000 B.C.E., this addictive sweetener has since come to dominate our appetites&#x2014;whether in candy, desserts, soft drinks, or even pasta sauces&#x2014;for better and for worse. In this book, Andrew F. Smith offers a fascinating history of this simultaneously beloved and reviled ingredient, holding its incredible value as a global commodity up against its darker legacies of slavery and widespread obesity.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> As Smith demonstrates, sugar&#x2019;s past is chockfull of determined adventurers: relentless sugar barons and plantation owners who worked alongside plant breeders, food processors, distributors, and politicians to build a business based on our cravings. Exploring both the sugarcane and sugar beet industries, he tells story after story of those who have made fortunes and those who have met demise all because of sugar&#x2019;s simple but profound hold on our palates. Delightful and surprisingly action-packed, this book offers a layered and definitive tale of sugar and the many people who have been caught in its spell&#x2014;from barons to slaves, from chefs to the countless among us born with that insatiable devil, the sweet tooth. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Andrew F.

And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas!&#39; As knights of old buckled on armour of supernatural power, so Hunter S. Thompson enters Las Vegas armed with a veritable arsenal of &#39;heinous chemicals&#39;. His perilous, drug-enhanced confrontations with casino operators, bartenders, police officers and assorted representatives of the Silent Majority have a hallucinatory humour and nightmare terror never before seen on the printed page.</p><p>Heralded as the "best book on the dope decade" by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, Hunter S. Thompson's documented drug orgy through Las Vegas would no doubt leave Nancy Reagan blushing and D.A.R.E. founders rethinking their motto. Under the pseudonym of Raoul Duke, Thompson travels with his Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo, in a souped-up convertible dubbed the "Great Red Shark." In its trunk, they stow "two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.... A quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls," which they manage to consume during their short tour. <p> On assignment from a sports magazine to cover "the fabulous Mint 400"--a free-for-all biker's race in the heart of the Nevada desert--the drug-a-delic duo stumbles through Vegas in hallucinatory hopes of finding the American dream (two truck-stop waitresses tell them it's nearby, but can't remember if it's on the right or the left). They of course never get the story, but they do commit the only sins in Vegas: "burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help." For Thompson to remember and pen his experiences with such clarity and wit is nothing short of a miracle; an impressive feat no matter how one feels about the subject matter. A first-rate sensibility twinger, <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> is a pop-culture classic, an icon of an era past, and a nugget of pure comedic genius. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the best chronicle of drug-soaked, addle-brained, rollicking good times ever committed to the printed page. It is also the tale of a long weekend road trip that has gone down in the annals of American pop culture as one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken. <br>Now this cult classic of gonzo journalism is a major motion picture from Universal, directed by Terry Gilliam and starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro.

Beautifully designed and illustrated, this invaluable book will be treasured by all watercolorists&#x2014;from complete beginners to experienced painters looking for ways to improve their own paintings. <br>Dover (2001) unabridged republication of the enlarged second edition originally published by Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, 1974.</p><h2>Sun Tzu Was a Sissy: Conquer Your Enemies, Promote Your Friends, and Wage the Real Art of War</h2><p><p>A hilarious and tough-minded guide to winning the war of contemporary life.</p><p> We live in a vicious, highly competitive workplace environment, and things aren&#x2032;t getting any better. Jobs are few and far between, and people aren&#x2032;t any nicer now than they were when Ghengis Khan ran around in big furs killing people in unfriendly acquisitions. For thousands of years, people have been reading the writings of the deeply wise, but also extremely dead Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, who was perhaps the first to look on the waging of war as a strategic art that could be taught to people who wished to be warlords and other kinds of senior managers. </p><p> In a nutshell, Sun Tzu taught that readiness is all, that knowledge of oneself and the enemy was the foundation of strength and that those who fight best are those who are prepared and wise enough not to fight at all. Unfortunately, in the current day, this approach is pretty much horse hockey, a fact that has not been recognized by the bloated, tree-hugging Sun Tzu industry, which churns out mushy-gushy pseudo-philosophy for business school types who want to make war and keep their hands clean. </p><p> Sun Tzu was a Sissy will transcend all those efforts and teach the reader how to make war, win and enjoy the plunder in the real world, where those who do not kick, gouge and grab are left behind at the table to pay the tab. Students of Bing will be taught how to plan and execute battles that hurt other people a lot, and advance their flags and those of their friends, if possible. All military strategies will be explored, from mustering, equipping, organizing, plotting, scheming, rampaging, squashing and reaping spoils. </p><p> Every other book on The Art of War bows low to Sun Tzu.

Why was the Arts and Crafts movement so popular with the American middle class at the end of the 19th century? Why did Modernism replace traditional architectural styles after World War II? Mark Gelernter provides fresh answers to questions like these, convincingly showing how buildings express powerful cultural forces. Embodying deeply felt attitudes about fundamental issues, buildings express our relationship with nature, our social relations with others, the importance of the individual, the value of science and technology, and our political role in the world. He explains how designers sometimes expressed these ideas with available building technologies, while at other times they invented new technologies in order to realize new ideas. Each of the ten chronological chapters, accompanied by almost 300 photographs, drawings, and maps, begins with a broad survey of the dominant cultural forces and technologies, and then discusses how designers of the day responded with particular architectural forms.</p><p>7 1/2 x 9 1/4 trim. 191 illus. 84 drawings. 23 plans. 10 maps. LC 98-51812&#x201c;Mark Gelernter has written an expansive interpretation of American architecture that is rooted in intellectual history . . . A provocative book [that provides] a broad understanding of the cultural forces that influence our built environment.&#x201d;&#x2014;Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians <p>&#x201c;A complete history of American architecture would fill a bookcase, but one can gain a strong understanding of this fascinating and challenging subject from this excellent survey, which describes American architecture in ten chronologically ordered chapters . . . By providing a global framework for American architecture, it guides the reader to evaluate the influence of major cultural events on architecture and provides the basis for understanding the ongoing search for an American architectural style. The author ties the broad picture of the development of American architecture to specific places and times by opening each chapter with a map of North America that illustrates major geopolitical, economic, and cultural events . . . The strengths of this book, and its contributions to the study of American architecture, lie in its broad description of the history of American architecture, including a thorough explanation of the architecture of the first civilizations of North America; its parallel exploration of the development of the architecture of Native Americans, Europeans, and Americans; its excellent mixture of photographs and line drawings of buildings throughout history; and its extensive glossary and bibliography. This book is a welcome and serious addition to the literature on the history of American architecture and should find itself on the shelves of scholars, graduate students, and other lovers of architecture.&#x201d;&#x2014;APT Bulletin: The Journal of Preservation Technology </p><p>&#x201c;This significant and needed book provides for the first time a useful and manageable historic framework for survey courses whose purpose is to teach the history of American architecture and not merely its connoisseurship.

For this special twentieth anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be. // Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, Celebration of Discipline explores the &#34;classic Disciplines,&#34; or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found.</p><p>When Richard Foster began writing <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> more than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: "Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter." Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of "intense intimacy and awful reverence," he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate. <p> Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that "our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><p>In the twenty years since its publication, <em>Celebration of Discipline</em> has helped over a million seekers discover a richer spiritual life infused with joy, peace, and a deeper understanding of God. Hailed by many as the best modern work on Christian spirituality, <em>Celebration of Discipline</em> explores the "classic Disciplines," or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found.</p><p>Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contributes to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration bring us nearer to one another and to God.Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities -- and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and "bring the abundance of God into our lives." The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance -- for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. <em>Celebration of Discipline</em> will help motivate Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.</p></p><h2>The Great Pearl Heist: London s Greatest Thief and Scotland Yard s Hunt for the World s Most Valuable Necklace</h2><p><i>London, 1913.</i> An exquisite strand of pale pink pearls, worth more than the Hope Diamond, has been bought by a Hatton Garden broker, capturing the attention of both jewelers and thieves. In transit to London from Paris, the necklace vanishes without a trace.<br>&nbsp;<br>Joseph Grizzard, &#x201c;the King of Fences,&#x201d; is the leader of a vast gang of thieves in London&#x2019;s East End. Having risen from the deadly streets to become a wealthy family man, Grizzard still cannot resist the sport of crime, and the pearl necklace proves an irresistible challenge.<br>&nbsp;<br>Inspector Alfred Ward has joined the brand-new division of the Metropolitan Police known as &#x201c;detectives.&#x201d; Having caught some of the great murderers of Victorian London, Ward is now charged with finding the missing pearls and the thief who stole them.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the spirit of <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>, this is the true story of a psychological cat-and-mouse game. Thoroughly researched and compellingly colorful, <i>The Great Pearl Heist</i> is a gripping narrative account of this little-known, yet extraordinary crime.</p><p>In researching my second book,&nbsp;<i>Asleep</i>, I became fascinated with this time period--the historical tipping point of 1913, the end of a golden age. &nbsp;I ran across the story of the pearl heist in newspaper coverage from that year and loved the idea. &nbsp;It's rare to come across a historical, true story in which no one knows the ending. &nbsp;While the plot alone seemed ready-made for a book, I also loved the chance to delve deeper into Scotland Yard history and their relatively new detective unit. &nbsp;And it's hard not to love the gentleman thief--one who finds honest work for his gang members when they need it and financially supports the family of any gang member sent to prison. That proved to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of writing this book--the characters are all so likable (well,&nbsp;<i>almost</i>&nbsp;all of them). It was a pleasure to be able to live in their world--1913 London--for the three years that I researched and wrote this book. And I was genuinely sad to see how much their lives changed as World War I descended upon London. &nbsp;The war, however, and its major impact on the city is also what left this gem of a story undiscovered for so long--and for that I am grateful.<b>Molly Caldwell Crosby</b> is the national bestselling author of <i>Asleep: The Forgotten Epidemic That Remains One of Medicine&#x2019;s Greatest Mysteries</i> and <i>The American Plague: The Untold Story of Yellow Fever, the Epidemic That Shaped Our History</i>, which has been nominated for several awards.

Written by two of the world&#39;s foremost authorities on space history, Hubble: Imaging Space and Time illuminates the solar system&#39;s workings, the expansion of the universe, the birth and death of stars, the formation of planetary nebulae, the dynamics of galaxies, and the mysterious force known as &#34;dark energy.&#34; The potential impact of this book cannot be overstressed: The 2008 servicing mission to install new high-powered scientific instruments is especially high profile because the cancellation of the previous mission, in 2004, caused widespread controversy. The authors reveal the inside story of Hubble&#39;s beginnings, its controversial early days, the drama of its first servicing missions, and the creation of the dynamic images that reach into the deepest regions of visible space, close to the time when the universe began. A wealth of astonishing images leads us to the very edge of known space, setting the stage for the new James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2013. Find the stunning panoramic of Carina Nebula, detailing star birth as never before; a jet from a black hole in one galaxy striking a neighboring galaxy; a jewel-like collection of galaxies from the early years of the universe; and a giant galaxy cannibalizing a smaller galaxy. Timed for the 2008 shuttle launch and coinciding with the 400th anniversary of Galileo&#39;s first telescope, Hubble: Imaging Space and Time accompanies a high-profile exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum and will be featured on the popular NASM website.</p><p></p><h2>Outlive Your Life: You Were Made to Make A Difference</h2><p><p></p><p>These are&nbsp;difficult days in&nbsp;our world&#x2019;s history.&nbsp; Billions of people are poor, millions go hungry or thirsty every day.&nbsp; Disease claims thousands of lives daily.&nbsp; But you and I have been given an opportunity to make a big difference.&nbsp; What if we did?&nbsp; What if we rocked the world with hope?&nbsp; Infiltrated all corners with God&#x2019;s love and life?

It was Eula Mae who came up with the idea of selling sandwiches at lunchtime, and they soon became legendary, drawing businessmen from the mainland eight miles away. Besides cooking and managing the commissary, Eula Mae was often called on to prepare food for Walter McIlhenny, late owner of the McIlhenny Company.&nbsp; He often asked her to cook for parties and brunches, preferring her down-home cooking to that of his personal chef.Acadiana "Cajun" cooking, America's popular regional cuisine, is captured here by self-taught Dore, who has lived on Avery Island, La., since 1949. With her husband, she managed the Tabasco Company Commissary, cooking for the island's residents, visitors and owners, the McIlhenny family. The book, written with Bienvenu (a Cajun expert best known for co-authoring four books with Emeril Lagasse), is divided into seasons that reflect the rhythm of the island and the cyclical nature of the produce and ingredients used. Within each season, the recipes are divided into menus marking different events, from a May Wedding with Party Pecan Tarts using a flaky cream cheese pastry dough, through a Fourth of July Barbecue with its uncomplicated Commissary Cole Slaw and Eula Mae's Potato Salad (given a kick from Tabasco pepper sauce), to A Family Thanksgiving Feast with a simple Roasted Chicken. Brief descriptions before each recipe ("grits, for those of you not familiar with them, are simply finely ground corn") give the book a homey feel that echoes Dore's dishes, and the reminiscences that she sprinkles throughout add flavor and color to a book that brings this traditional regional style to kitchens everywhere. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life Application Study Bible NLT, Limited Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the <i>Life Application Study Bible,</i> Tyndale is releasing special versions of the most popular editions ever.

Although rarely screened now, these short films captured a virtual who's who of the avant-garde, including such cultural icons as Edie Sedgwick, Bob Dylan, Salvador Dali, and Susan Sontag. At last, in the initial volume of the authorized catalogue raisonn� of Warhol's films, Warhol authority Callie Angell examines all 189 people captured by Warhol's lens. Stills from many of the films appear here for the first time. Drawing on 13 years of original research into the Screen Test subjects and their relationships to Warhol, Angell provides an unprecedented look at the pop art master's working method, and a unique record of his colorful social and professional life.</p><p>Callie Angell is internationally recognized as the foremost authority on the films of Andy Warhol. She has been adjunct curator of the Andy Warhol Film Project at the Whitney Museum of American Art and consultant to The Museum of Modern Art on the preservation of Warhol&#39;s cinema since 1991. Angell lives in New York City.In 1963, Warhol began making short, silent films of the people who came through his New York studio, accumulating personalities in the same way he collected Campbell's soup cans or Brillo boxes. The first in a two-volume catalogue (which will eventually encompass all of Warhol's cinema), this book offers some surprisingly engrossing entries, while serving as a basic reference guide to the films. In addition to supplying the expected cataloguing data (dates, running time, cast, credits and other notations), the capsule biographies of the subjects and film action narratives reveal the fascinating and creative world of the Factory. Here is the tragic Freddy Herko, who "danced out the window of John Dodd's fifth-floor apartment"; models Ivy Nicholson and Imu; poets John Ashbery and Ted Berrigan; and musicians Lou Reed and Bob Dylan. Equally interesting are blurbs about the unknowns: "A young man named Stevie, with an illegible last name. Near the end of the roll, someone throws water on his face from offscreen." Several essays speculate about Warhol's overarching intentions for the films and discuss their mysteriously limited showings. Extravagantly produced with 780 photographs, the book reinforces the sense of Warhol as an expert in subverting notions of celebrity. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nick and Clay are running away from their turbulent lives in New York City, each desperate for a happier, freer future someplace else. Their method of escape?

Their future awaits, but it is built on disastrous deceits, and more than one life stands in the way of their dreams. </p><p><em>A Beautiful Crime</em> is a twisty grifter novel with a thriller running through its veins.

Having completed her Ph.D. in English literature, she now lives and works in a hundred-year old house in the Upper Midwest. She is a winner of the Spectrum Award for her short story, &#34;Three Letters from the Queen of Elfland.&#34;Wizard Felix Harrogate's master has stripped Felix of his magic in a sadistic ritual that destroyed the Virtu, which protects the city of Melusine, and had him declared a heretic outcast. Felix, maddened by this disaster, and his brother, cat burglar-assassin Mildmay the Fox, permanently injured by a magical curse gone awry, have spent considerable time recovering, and now Felix wants his former life, status, and power back. He determines to do the impossible: return to Melusine and repair and reactivate the Virtu. He doesn't, however, count on encountering his former master, Malker Gennadion, face-to-face. In another fine, compelling volume, Monette tidies up the loose ends and unresolved issues of <i>Melusine</i> (2005). Often-insufferable Felix and street-savvy Mildmay are nicely developed further, and a new central character, Mehitabel Parr, adds color and balance to their cadre. As before, no one is exactly who or what he or she seems, which only increases the fun. The magic is delightfully inventive, and the world Monette creates includes some truly intriguing aspects. Nor could one find a more deliciously sadistic villain than Malker. Perhaps best of all is Monette's authorial voice, abundantly blessed with originality, sophistication, and artistry. <i>Paula Luedtke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Owen and Ben hunted tur�tles among the waterweeds and pale aquatic flowers. The turtles sunned themselves on low branches hanging over the water, in shafts of light spotted with dancing dragonflies. Ever alert, the creatures tumbled into the swamp at the first sound, as though wiped from the branches by an unseen hand. The wild surround�ings made Ben exuberant. He bent saplings to watch them recoil or shinnied up trees, and he returned home carrying things that interested him&#x2014;strands of waterweed, bleached muskrat skulls, or the jack-in-the-pulpits he brought to his mother to fend off her irritation at having to wash another load of muddy clothes. Once, Owen caught two of the less-vigilant turtles, the size of fifty-cent pieces, with poignant little feet constantly trying to get somewhere that only they knew. Owen loved their tiny per�fection, the flexible undersides of their shells, the ridges down their topside that he could detect with his thumbnail. Their necks were striped yellow, and they stretched them upward in their striving. Owen made a false bottom for his lunch box with ventilation holes so that he could always have them with him, despite the rule against taking pets to school or on the school bus. He fed them flies from a bottle cap. Only Ben knew where they were.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon, Owen came back from the swamp to find the flashing beacon of the town&#x2019;s fire truck illuminating the faces of curious neighbors outside his house. He ran up the short length of his driveway in time to see his mother addressing a small crowd as she stood beside two firemen in obsolete leather hel�mets with brass eagles fixed to their fronts. She looked slightly disheveled in a housedress and golf-club windbreaker, and she spoke in the lofty voice she used when she had been drinking, the one meant to fend off all questions: &#x201c;Let he who has never had a kitchen grease fire cast the first stone!&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Blame the television. Watching <i>The Guiding Light. </i>Mea culpa. A souffl�.&#x201d; Owen felt the complete bafflement of the neighborhood as he listened. Then her tone flattened. &#x201c;Look, the fire&#x2019;s gone. Good night, one and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owen&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s car nosed up to the group. His father jumped out, tie loosened, radiating authority. He pushed straight through to the firefighters without glancing at his wife. &#x201c;Handled?&#x201d; The shorter of the two nodded quickly. His father spoke to the neighbors: &#x201c;Looks like not much. I&#x2019;ll get the details, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d; Most had wandered off toward their own homes by then, the &nbsp;Kershaws among the last to go. Owen&#x2019;s father turned to his wife, who was staring listlessly at the ground, placed his broad hand on the small of her back, and moved her through the front door, which he closed behind him, leaving Owen alone in the yard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Owen went in, his parents were sitting at opposite sides of the kitchen table, the <i>Free Press </i>spread out in front of them. The brown plastic Philco murmured a Van Patrick inter�view with Birdie Tebbetts: it was the seventh-inning stretch in the Indians game. Owen&#x2019;s father motioned to him to have a seat, which he did while trying to get the drift of the interview. His mother didn&#x2019;t look up, except to access the flip lid on her silver ashtray. She held a Parliament between her thumb and middle finger, delicately tapping the ash free with her forefinger. His father flicked the ash from his Old Gold with his thumbnail at the butt of the cigarette and made no particular effort to see that it landed in the heavy glass ashtray by his wrist. Commenting on what he had just read, his father said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s blow &#x2019;em up before they blow us up!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; his mother said, but got no answer. Instead, she turned to Owen. &#x201c;Your father and I are going to take a break from each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, yeah?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We thought you&#x2019;d want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father lifted his head to glance at Owen, then returned to the paper. Owen knew better than to say a single word, unless it was about the weather. He wanted his parents to be distracted, so that he could fit in more baseball and get any kind of hair�cut he liked, but he worried about things falling apart entirely. He was unable to picture what might lie beyond that. School, of course, out there like a black cloud.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother said, &#x201c;Ma said she&#x2019;d take me in.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this, his father raised his head from the paper. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Alice, no one is &#x2018;taking you in.&#x2019; You&#x2019;re not homeless.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t <i>you </i>go someplace, and I&#x2019;ll stay here? Maybe someone will take you in.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you why: I&#x2019;ve got a business to run.&#x201d; His business, which dispatched plumbers and electricians to emergencies, was called Don&#x2019;t Get Mad, Get Egan and made the sort of living known as decent. With tradesmen on retainer, he worked from an office, a hole-in-the-wall above a florist&#x2019;s shop. An answering service gave the impression that it was a bigger operation than it was.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ma will think you&#x2019;ve failed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, you tell Ma I haven&#x2019;t failed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, you tell her, sport.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not calling your mother to tell her that I haven&#x2019;t failed. That doesn&#x2019;t make sense. Owen, where have you been?

When he lifted a forkful of buttery, syrup-glazed sweet to my mouth, my lips parted baby-bird-like. &#x201c;Zoop, that waffle was gone!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;d give you another and &#x2018;Zoop!&#x2019;?&#x201d; he teased. When he wasn&#x2019;t fast enough, I grabbed waffles with my fists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Zoop! Zoop!&#x201d;<br> <br>Although he laughed and told the story over and over, it was clear from his bemusement that I had somehow broken the rules.<br> <br>That appetite landed me on the outside of what passed as appropriate for girls in my family. My taste for life extended well beyond food; I had a tendency to charge at the world, to take it all in. &#x201c;My little bull,&#x201d; Barbara, my petite pearls-and-diamonds grandmother, called me. My knees were always scuffed, my elbows rough and dry, my shoulders and feet too big, my hair full of knots. I wanted to rub up against things but lived under an umbrella of expectation: Why wasn&#x2019;t I more refined? More girlie? I licked the sidewalk because I liked the taste of dirt, and I dug up worms after a strong rain so I could watch them tunnel and wiggle in the plastic tub in the garage where I kept them. I was certain the world held mystery and I yearned to gather it by the fistful. When I was four, I jumped up and down on my parents&#x2019; bed in front of the vanity in our Sunnyvale, California, trailer, telling my mother one day I would leap into the mirror and go live with the little girl I saw there. Later, I raced invisible friends on roller skates around the outer elbow of the Bay Area cul-de-sac where we lived for a few years, kicked around the West by my father&#x2019;s Air Force career: me; my brothers, Chris and Steve, who bookended me in age; my parents; and our dog, Mitzi.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go put your clothes on,&#x201d; Grandpa Pete shouted, as I ran naked through his house at age three, five, seven. Such exuberance was troubling.<br> <br>Once, lamenting that I was the opposite of dainty, Barbara, who never stopped trying to coax my hair into curls and my hands into my lap, stretched my fingers into a chord on a toy piano I&#x2019;d gotten for Christmas and exclaimed, &#x201c;These hands, these chubby little hands!&#x201d; as if the shape of my limbs was a character flaw for which I should be accountable.<br> <br>My future appeared in the form of two dolls I was given: one, a nun in a black and white habit, the other, a bride, dressed in veiled white lace. I placed both quietly in their boxes on a shelf in my bedroom until the day I chopped the head off the bride for an art project and buried the nun in the backyard.<br> <br>I hated dolls.<br> <br>Even though I saw women burning their bras on the nightly news, my family, led by the old-world swagger of my Italian father, remained impervious to the social revolution whose epicenter was a mere fifty miles up the Bay Area coastline from our first house. Instead of hippies and Haight-Ashbury, I knew about Vietnam and the Zodiac Killer, a faceless monster I worried haunted the bushes on my way to school.<br> <br>We had moved to Milpitas, California, located off the Nimitz Freeway at the &#x201c;stinky exit&#x201d;&#x2014;so named because the air was thick with the peaty smell of cow manure and salt marshes&#x2014;just before I began elementary school. The hills were rolling and green, if always vaguely obscured by fog and&#x2014;even then&#x2014;smog. Our gold stucco house tucked inside the last court on the edge of the housing development was palatial compared to the trailers we&#x2019;d lived in&#x2014;first in Nevada, where I was born, and then in Sunnyvale, where my father was later stationed. For the first time, we had our own washing machine and dishwasher, and my father made much of the fact that he&#x2019;d gotten to choose not only the color of the house but the avocado-green appliances and two-toned shag rug. We were coming up in the world!<br> <br>I learned to roller-skate and ride a bike on Moon Court, playing for hours alone with my cartoon friends, Marine Boy and Little Audrey. Girlfriends were scarce. I had only Irene, a blue-eyed beauty from Texas who lived next door, but she was several years older. She had long lashes and dark hair that curled slightly around her freckled face and was Texas polite, saying &#x201c;yes, ma&#x2019;am&#x201d; or &#x201c;sir&#x201d; to my parents. She invited me over to play dress-up with her Dawn dolls, the shorter, more glamorous version of Barbie, but I couldn&#x2019;t sit through more than one costume change, even though I longed for Dawn&#x2019;s hot-pink evening gown with the sparkly silver bodice.<br> <br>No matter how hard I tried to cajole her, Irene wasn&#x2019;t interested in running or riding bikes or fishing for crawdads in the ditch out back with me. Instead she instructed me on the qualities of a lady, once telling me if I was too proud of my long hair, gremlins would come in the night and chew it off.<br> <br>This left the other kids on the block&#x2014;all boys&#x2014;who wanted to play either chase or doctor, and my brothers, who forged an alliance over G.I. Joes and Army games and model airplanes, bonding over anatomy and naming their penises Mortimer and Charlie. They kept a &#x201c;pee bank&#x201d; in the scrap pile on the side of the house in a Mr. Clean bottle. I tried once to make my own deposit, squatting among wet lumber and mud over the narrow bottle opening with predictable results.<br> <br>In my family, women were parsley on the plate&#x2014;accessories or helpmates: My grandmother Barbara, a slim beauty with Betty Grable legs, was the elegant accompaniment to my grandfather&#x2019;s powerful presence; my mother sailed through her life behind a cloud of Salem smoke, always tired. Lethally silent. The adult child of two pugnacious alcoholics, she had learned from an early age to stay out of the line of fire, and denied her own profession by parents who refused to pay for college because she was female, at eighteen she joined the Air Force, where she met my father, &#x201c;Wally Cakes.&#x201d; I believe he was the first man she ever kissed. By twenty, she was married, pregnant, and discharged from the service. Back then, you could be career military or you could have kids. Mom quietly followed my father&#x2019;s Air Force career from California to Nevada and back before moving to Colorado and Hawaii, all the while working one dead-end retail job after another to help the family make ends meet.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t have one solid memory of her from those early years. Instead, all I have is a collection of images: my blond mother holding up a frilly baby-blue nightgown at Christmas when I was six; Mom in cat-eye glasses standing in front of an Easter ham decorated with pineapple and cherries when I was seven; Mom, neat looking in the shag du jour, posing in a light blue dress suit with her parents in front of a mission in Monterey. But these are photographs from the family album. In them, my mother is a static figure, captured mid&#x2013;half smile, frozen in time. And that&#x2019;s how she was at home: a bug under glass. I watched for years as she was pressed flat under the weight of my father&#x2019;s volatile personality.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go put your face on,&#x201d; my father shouted at her. He harangued, then menaced. Eventually, a decade into their union, he hit.<br> <br>Dad was handsome, with pouty lips and a shock of black hair combed back from his face. No wonder my mother fell for him. He was larger than life and charismatic, but unpredictable&#x2014;charming in one instant and boiling mad the next. No one knew when things were going to blow up.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>The stories of my family are the stories of men. I grew up in the shadow their larger-than-life selves cast, coveting the pleasures of gusto and sheer masculine joy. Each lived with the kind of prerogative and independence I would be denied. Plainly put: Men did things, women watched. Their escapades were the mythology of my childhood: tales of my great-grandfather Bernardo, a giant at six feet eight, who guarded the Italian King Umberto and later mined diamonds in Africa and was alleged to have killed two men who tried to rob him by crushing them together inside the circle of his massive arms. He&#x2019;d come to America with my great-grandmother, who would die during childbirth, and moved out west to mine coal in Utah, later dying of consumption.<br> <br>Or Pete, Bernardo&#x2019;s son, a Depression-era urchin who survived starvation at an orphanage by eating bugs off the walls and, at fourteen, herded sheep in Utah. He spent long days and nights in the canyon country near Bryce on horseback, a dog and big blue western skies as his only companions. From an early age, I was haunted by the story of him alone in the wilderness and yearned for that kind of adventure.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s tales were of his misadventures, consisting largely of the naughty things he&#x2019;d done on his uncle&#x2019;s Wyoming ranch or to earn a ruler across his hands in Catholic boarding school in the forties. During a lesson on hell, he raised his hand and asked the nun if, after he died, could he go live with the devil? It sounded more fun.<br> <br>One of his favorite pranks was to take us through the drive-thru, ordering in a mock Chinese accent only to switch to a swarthy Frenchman or a daft Dutchman at the window as my brothers and I giggled.<br> <br>Once I tried to emulate my father&#x2019;s bravado, dramatically telling him a joke going around school about the little red wagon. I reached the punch line, pleased with my performance, giggling uncontrollably, until my father shook me by the shoulders and told me the joke was dirty, forbidding me to speak to or play with the nasty little girl who&#x2019;d told it to me.<br> <br>Left out of the family heroic narrative and lacking someone to look up to, I developed an instinct for going it alone. I would do it all by myself. Just five and unable to tell time or read, I knew that when Sesame Street ended in the late morning, it was time to go to school. My mother had already left for work by the time I picked up my Josie and the Pussycats lunch box and went to wake my father, who was sleeping off the graveyard shift of a second job. Then, I walked the mile to school.<br> <br>If I was good . . . I thought, because good was the best thing I could be. Trouble was, being a good girl meant not only being obedient and polite but, most impossibly, being pretty. I was plain and a bit chubby. My front teeth met in an arrow-like point; my smile was an awkward apology. When my dad, who liked to imagine he could see into the future, prognosticated about his children, he said Steve would be an astronaut, Chris a scientist, and I, he&#x2019;d proclaim as if bestowing the best gift, would be &#x201c;Miss America 1982.&#x201d; He might as well have said I&#x2019;d grow up to be a horse or a swan. His prediction wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a vote for my beauty; instead he was imagining the best, most successful thing I could be.<br> <br>Caught between the competing desires to be a good girl and to get in on the action, between acceptance and rebellion, I zigzagged through my early years like a deer stuck inside a fence. I so often fell short that I thought I must be bad, taking as evidence that I&#x2019;d once hit my grandmother in the face when she sweetly leaned down to kiss me good night. Her late-night embrace had startled me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh! Well!&#x201d; she harrumphed, walking away. Mortified, I aped ignorance when she inquired the next day, &#x201c;Honey, you didn&#x2019;t mean to hit your grammy, did you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Determined to correct my wickedness, I decided what I lacked in traditional good-girl looks or patience I would make up for in obedience. If I couldn&#x2019;t be one kind of good girl, I&#x2019;d be another. Once, promised a whipping by my father when we got home, I dutifully retrieved the belt myself and handed it to him.<br> <br>But adherence to the laws of my family provided only passing relief. A larger institution promised greater reward: the Catholic Church. The church was the place of a perfection so sweet that saints shimmered with golden halos and my irreproachable grandfather teared up every time he worked his fingers over his black pearl rosary. I wanted to be just as saintly, just as virtuous. When I&#x2019;d learned in catechism the story of a girl who&#x2019;d seen a baby in the road and pushed it out of the way of an oncoming car only to die&#x2014;but die a good Catholic&#x2014;I was constantly on the lookout for people and animals to save at my own peril. The fact that my dying seemed to make the act holier made it all the more desirable. After I was told good pious Catholics crossed themselves when they passed a church&#x2014;any church&#x2014;I began the practice at seven. Instinctively, I&#x2019;d come to understand that my lot was to convince others of my virtuousness. So I dutifully said the half dozen Our Fathers the priest gave me for confession after he&#x2019;d lectured me in the dark closet of the confessional about &#x201c;honoring thy father and mother,&#x201d; even though I hadn&#x2019;t mentioned Mom or Dad, or confessed to defiance. I had obedience down.<br> <br>My sins were lies and greed.<br> <br>I stole Neapolitan coconut candy from the store for the fifty-cent Saturday matinee until the day my father caught me and hauled me screaming &#x201c;No, Daddy, no!&#x201d; up the aisle to the store manager, who I swear had a cop on hand who showed me his handcuffs and said he could take me away and I&#x2019;d have to spend the night in the clink. Another time, I convinced my older brother, Chris, already a guilt-ridden child who carried the heavy expectation of being firstborn, that he had broken the washer lid by climbing on top of it.<br> <br>And, I liked to tell stories.<br> <br>At show-and-tell, I excitedly displayed the seashell figurine I&#x2019;d gotten on Fisherman&#x2019;s Wharf or the strange Easter basket made from a hollowed-out bleach container, topped with a rubber Mother Goose head, lining up my special items weeks in advance. But once I ran through my repertoire, I made things up. I reported with glee that Mitzi, our spayed half basset hound&#x2013;half German shepherd, had had puppies that wiggled and whined and slept like little balls of brown and black dough curled up against their mama&#x2019;s white tummy. Another week it was our nonexistent cat, Midnight, who&#x2019;d had a litter and kittens that were mewing all over the house. Still later, my mother was pregnant with twins. I don&#x2019;t know why I saw birth as the answer to my state of affairs&#x2014;it hadn&#x2019;t worked out all that well for me.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>On the weekends, my brothers and I did what my father wanted to do: fish, go to the base to watch the fighter jets in air races, bet on horses, bowl, see the newest sci-fi film, scour rose beds and parks in Sacramento for the Bee&#x2019;s annual treasure hunt, where my father was sure This year! we&#x2019;d be the ones to decipher the weekly clues and find the object that proclaimed us the &#x201c;lucky winner!&#x201d; of a huge cash prize. Dad was certain that his big payout was just one bet, one stroke of luck away.<br> <br>My father, who boasted he couldn&#x2019;t get lost in the woods, was a born outdoorsman who hunted elk and deer. Above all, I loved camping and fishing with him. Our trips were expeditions in which Dad packed the station wagon full of coolers and sleeping bags, aluminum chairs, fishing poles, our fifty-pound tent, and always, a huge batch of spaghetti he&#x2019;d spent the entire day making. I learned to shoot a .22 and gut a trout and spot deer. Nature, I understood, was simultaneously glorious and dangerous. At night, inside the thick skin of our canvas tent, I&#x2019;d lie awake breathless, half-terrified, half-awestruck that I couldn&#x2019;t see my hand waving just inches from my face, and imagine my fingers drifting like stars in the nigh...</p><h2>The Earth, the Temple, and the Gods: Greek Sacred Architecture, Revised Edition</h2><p>Absolutely essential book for understanding Greek temples</p><p></p><h2>A Sister&#39;s Test (Sisters of Holmes County, Book 2)</h2><p><p>When tragedy strikes in Holmes County, Ruth Hostettler&#x2019;s faith is put to the test.

She has lived in Marin County, California, since 1971.<br><b> <i>The Best of It</i> - Pulitzer Prize Winner for Poetry </b><br> Everything [Ryan&#x2019;s] eye falls upon takes on a brisk, beautifully complete clarity. Her tidy lines disguise an enormous intelligence and tonal warmth: a ferocious capacity for finding the essence of things. The Best of It reveals that right before our eyes Ryan has become a classic American poet.&#x201d; John Freeman, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> Ryan is one of the few contemporary poets to have imitators because she is one of the few truly compelling stylists now at work. Her voice is authoritative, confident, unfussy, exacting she is astutely reserved, watchful, and understands that no one is special in his or her grief So many new and selected&#x201d; volumes come out each year, but <i>The Best of It</i> is rare in being truly the best of the poet&#x2019;s work so far. Kay Ryan is so disarming, so fresh and original, that she has earned her recent reputation as one of the very best poets among us.&#x201d; David Mason, <i>The Hudson Review</i><br><br> Ryan&#x2019;s poems are consistent delights. They fizz with euphonies, they crackle with rhyme and off-rhyme they are marvels of compact, slightly bitter wit Ryan&#x2019;s poems are what Robert Frost said all poems must be, momentary stays against confusion.&#x201d; Stephen Burt, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"<i>The Best of It</i> is a generous and nearly career-spanning collection of her verse, a greatest-hits album of a sort you can&#x2019;t help consuming [her] poems quickly, the way you are supposed to consume freshly made cocktails: while they are still smiling at you. But you immediately double back what was that? and their moral and intellectual bite blindsides you.&#x201d; Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br> Melancholy lucidity is Ryan&#x2019;s greatest gift, and it can be heard in all her most successful poems. But her most startling discovery is that melancholy, with its tendency to brood and spread, is best contained in a form that is tight, witty, almost sprightly sounding. Her poems are often built on the logic of the pun, taking an ordinary word or dead clich� as a title and then jolting it to unexpected life.&#x201d; Adam Kirsch, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> Ryan&#x2019;s oblique humor runs from grim to whimsical, from delighted to sardonic . . . Despite her desert beginnings, she cannot disavow her own talent and taste, her intelligence and achievement . . . From a life that has not been easy, she has mined nuggets that add to American poetic wealth.&#x201d; Helen Vendler, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br> Ryan may well be the oddest and wisest poet to hold that prestigious post. Her tiny, skinny poems back a punch unlike anything else in contemporary poetry, though not unlike haiku, if haiku could be cut with a dash of Groucho Marx. This, her first retrospective volume, which also contains a book&#x2019;s worth of new poems, is a much-needed introduction to the work of one of our best and most accessible poets. She asks the necessary questions hiding just beneath the obvious ones Pithy poems manage to encapsulate far more than their few words should hold Sassy, smart and deep as they are hilarious, Ryan&#x2019;s poems are among the best.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br> When she&#x2019;s at the top of her game, [Ryan] has the uncanny ability to construct a tiny word-mechanism that produces the experience of genuine wonder In the utter complexity of her vision and lyricism, I&#x2019;m reminded of those mechanical devices of the ancient world meant to show us our place among the stars and help us navigate the uncharted darkness beyond. And in the very best examples, Ryan&#x2019;s poems do precisely that.&#x201d; Steven Ratiner, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> Kay Ryan is a distinctive and original voice within the rich variety of contemporary American poetry. She writes easily understandable short poems on improbable subjects. Within her compact compositions there are many surprises in rhyme and rhythm and in sly wit pointing to subtle wisdom.&#x201d; Dr. James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress<br><br> Kay Ryan can take any subject and make it her own. Her poems which combine extreme concision and formal expertise with broad subjects and deep feeling could never be mistaken for anyone else&#x2019;s. Her work has the kind of singularity and sustained integrity that are very, very rare.&#x201d; Christian Wiman, editor of <i>Poetry</i> magazine and chair of the Ruth Lilly selection committee<br><br> [Ryan&#x2019;s] poems . . .

While chronicling the correspondence between two mysterious lovers, Bantock peppered his book with visual delights--macabre post cards, intricately designed stamps, exquisite envelopes that open to disclose hand-written letters. <i>Sabine's Notebook</i> and <i>The Golden Mean</i> soon followed to complete the trilogy. In many respects, <i>The Museum at Purgatory</i> resembles its predecessors, mixing metaphysics and art in a way meant to both puzzle and delight its readers. The narrator offers the basic premise early on: "My name is Non, and as Curator of the Museum here at Purgatory I am required by statute to facilitate, without judgment, the progress of all collectors assigned to these halls. It is my responsibility to act as their souls' guardian, as well as preserver of their accumulated treasures." Non then goes on to give a brief overview of the layout of Purgatory, a city that "takes a meditative, non-partisan view of reality" and where visitors are "faced with fundamental questions of self-worth" that must be resolved before they can move on. <p> In other words, this stopping place between heaven and hell is one big analyst's couch. Non's introduction to Purgatory scans like the overly formal, academic language one finds on informational panels in natural history museums--no doubt Bantock's intention. Unfortunately, this can become wearing after a while, and it isn't until the second half of the book when Non tells his own story (as opposed to the histories of the various "collections" under his care) that the prose loosens up somewhat. </p><p> But it's the illustrations that make Bantock's books special; it's unfortunate that several of them look as if they've escaped from a Dorling Kindersley guidebook--photographs of objects on stark backgrounds with a caption explaining their significance or use. Yet this museum contains some lovely examples of its author's art. As always, his stamps and postcards are exquisite--and how many cards are postmarked <i>Nirvana</i> or bear stamps from <i>Inferno</i>? This book may not equal the mystery or sheer beauty of the Griffin &amp; Sabine trilogy, but Nick Bantock fans will still find plenty to intrigue and amuse. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Artist and writer Nick Bantock is the author of the best-selling Griffin &amp; Sabine trilogy. <i> The Egyptian Jukebox, The Venetian's Wife,</i> and <i> The Forgetting Room.</i> He lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest.</p><h2>Showcase Presents: Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld Vol. 1</h2><p>Princess Amethyst, sole survivor of the House of Opal, was whisked away from Gemworld after her family was wiped out by the evil Dark Opal.

Then Henry II demands that she accompany his daughter and her formal procession to Italy and offers to &#x201c;keep&#x201d; her daughter with Queen Eleanor until her safe return. But death stalks the procession, and Adelia and her loyal friends soon realize that the killer is someone from her past bent on revenge. As with previous books in the series, historical details are many and add an extra layer of atmosphere. Readers who doubt the likelihood of a female Jewish pathologist in twelfth-century Britain will be reassured by Franklin&#x2019;s detailed historical notes at the end of the book. With some uneven pacing and a plot that relies heavily on previous series knowledge, this book isn&#x2019;t the best place to start for readers new to the series, but it will be enjoyed by series fans. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Ramage&#39;s Trial (Volume 14) (The Lord Ramage Novels, 14)</h2><p>Captain Lord Ramage and the Calypso return from Devil's Island, but Ramage's new wife Sarah is missing.

Ramage must clear his name&#x2014;or face a sentence of death!</p><p>Dudley Pope is well known, both as the creator of the Ramage novels and as a distinguished naval historian. Pope falsified his age in order to enlist in the British Merchant Navy during World War II. In action, his ship was torpedoed and he spent 14 days at sea in an open lifeboat. After being discharged due to the injuries he received, he worked as the naval and defense correspondent at the <i>London Daily News</i>. He turned to writing fiction at the urging of C. S. Forester, who viewed Pope as his creative heir. Author of ten scholarly works as well as the 18 books in the Ramage series, Dudley Pope died in 1997.Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope was born in 1925 into an ancient Cornish seafaring family. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror</p><h2>Wonder Woman Vol. 5: Flesh (The New 52)</h2><p>Wonder Woman's life is changed forever when she is called on to take the place of War on Olympus!

Beekman Place was hardly a Manhattan trouble zone.<br><br>The day was so nice he&#x2019;d decided to walk. No big deal. Only a couple of miles from his apartment, but a big jump in rental price. A cab ride would deprive him of this beautiful day.<br><br>Autumn was strengthening its grip on the city: cooler temperatures, gustier winds...sweater weather. Jack&#x2019;s was a cranberry V-neck, worn over a blue-and-white plaid shirt and tan slacks. The preppy look. Never out of place in Midtown. Medium-length brown hair, medium brown eyes, medium height, medium build. Nothing special about him. Just the way he liked it. Practically invisible.<br><br>The summer haze had fled south, leaving the midday sky a piercing blue; red and yellow leaves whirligigged from branches, and all the Duane Reades sported ghosts and goblins and spiderwebs in their windows. The official Halloween countdown had dwindled to less than twelve hours.<br><br>Just last night Vicky had put on her Wicked Witch of the West costume---green skin, warty nose, the whole deal---and modeled it for Jack. She fairly vibrated with anticipation. Nine years old going on forty, she loved dressing up, and loved candy. Halloween was the one day of the year---well, maybe Christmas too---that Gia let her daughter&#x2019;s sweettooth call the shots. Come November 1 it would be back to reality: Boca Burgers, kasha and beans, and one---just one---piece of candy for dessert.<br><br>And for me, Jack thought, one Whopper with cheese to go, please.<br><br>He&#x2019;d come down Central Park West, past a large, cheering rally of some sort on one of the park greens, walked east over to First Avenue, then turned downtown. The Trump World Tower was looming large in his vision when he hung a left onto East Fifty-first. A block later he stepped onto Beekman Place. It ran between Fifty-first and Forty-ninth. Right. A whole two blocks long.<br><br>Felt like he&#x2019;d stepped from a wrestling match into a library. The bare-bones bustle of First Avenue was gone, replaced by party-colored trees lining quiet pavements. He&#x2019;d Googled the area before coming over. Interesting history. Nathan Hale had been held prisoner in one of these mansions before his execution. Billy Rose used to live here, so had Irving Berlin, although his old place now housed the Luxembourg mission to the UN.<br><br>Jack walked past canopied front entrances attended by liveried doormen until he came to the brick and granite front of 37 Beekman Place. He nodded to the Hispanic-looking doorman in the gray uniform with black piping.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I help you, sir?&#x201d; His English carried only a hint of a Spanish accent. The nameplate over his left breast read Esteban.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to see Mrs. Roselli. She&#x2019;s expecting me.&#x201d;<br><br>Esteban led the way into an echoey lobby: white marble floor, white marble walls, white marble ceiling. He lifted the receiver attached to an intercom in the left lobby wall. &#x201c;And who shall I say is calling?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I have your last name, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just Jack. Like I said, she&#x2019;s expecting me.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked dubious but pressed two numbers on the pad. &#x201c;Ms. Roselli? There is a &#x2018;Jack&#x2019; here to see you.&#x201d;<br><br>Esteban listened a few seconds, then hung up. &#x201c;Apartment one A, sir.&#x201d; He pointed to a hallway leading off the lobby. &#x201c;First door on your right.&#x201d; He stared at Jack. &#x201c;Are you related?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. We&#x2019;ve never met. Why do you ask?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just curious. I&#x2019;ve been working here two years and you&#x2019;re the first company she&#x2019;s had. You&#x2019;ll like her. Nice lady. The best.&#x201d;<br><br>Glad to hear it, Jack thought. Nice ladies were always easier to work for than the not so nice. Later this afternoon he&#x2019;d be meeting another nice lady customer.<br><br>But so far Maria Roselli was a mystery. She&#x2019;d e-mailed him from his Web site, leaving a phone number, saying it was important. When Jack had called her back she was evasive about who had referred her, saying over and over how she was so worried about her son and how she needed Jack&#x2019;s help.<br><br>She was the second customer in two days who&#x2019;d refused to say who&#x2019;d referred her. Jack liked to know how his customers managed to find him. His services weren&#x2019;t exactly the kind he could advertise in the <em>Times</em>&#x2018; classified section. He&#x2019;d made some enemies along the way, so he tended to be wary of customers who popped up with no identifiable references.<br><br>But Beekman Place...the class of people who had a beef with him didn&#x2019;t live in seven-figure East Side co-ops.<br><br>So he&#x2019;d agreed to meet Maria Roselli without knowing who&#x2019;d referred her. He&#x2019;d also agreed to meet at her place. She&#x2019;d said she was physically handicapped and it would put a burden on her to meet him elsewhere.<br><br>Hadn&#x2019;t liked that either, but something in her voice...<br><br>Anyway, here he was. He knocked on 1A and a dog started barking.<br><br>A woman&#x2019;s voice on the other side said, &#x201c;Hush up, Benno. It&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Oh, hell, Jack thought. Another woman with a dog.<br><br>Maybe he should turn and go.<br><br>The voice rose in volume. &#x201c;Come in. It&#x2019;s open.&#x201d;<br><br>He took a breath and reached for the knob. Might as well see what was up. He hadn&#x2019;t committed to anything. Nothing said he couldn&#x2019;t walk away if he didn&#x2019;t like the setup.<br><br>Copyright � 2006 by F.

So, in accordance with the traditions of Pine Grove, it falls to Ruthie and her mother to bring home the perfect Christmas tree to donate to the town. Ruthie had accompanied her father to the rocky cliff where he marked a tree in the spring, so she and her mother set out to find it again, and haul it home. Their trip becomes the basisovernightof a new town legend; Ruthie, chosen for the role of the heavenly angel in the the church Christmas play, finds herself outfitted in a madeover wedding dress of the finest silkanother "miracle" wrought by her hardworking mother. An accomplished, fluid telling garnishes this simple story, as do Cooney's moonlit paintings of wintry evenings and the welcoming glow of fire and lanterns.

And as their importance wanes, a new hero, Dynaman, rallies the nation behind a fascist agenda...<br> &nbsp;<br> Comics greats James Robinson (STARMAN) and Paul Smith (<i>The Uncanny X-Men, Nexus</i>) turn history on its head in this celebrated Elseworlds tale featuring the Justice Society of America, collectsing THE GOLDEN AGE #1-4.</p><p>James Robinson is an acclaimed, award-winning writer whose works include STARMAN and JSA: THE GOLDEN AGE and SUPERMAN. With Geoff Johns, he was co-writer of HAWKMAN. In addition, he wrote the screenplay to <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>, starring Sean Connery, and created the acclaimed young readers comic series LEAVE IT TO CHANCE.Clearly influenced by Alan Moore's <i>Watchmen</i>, this reissue depicts DC's superheroes from the 1940s hanging up their capes following the end of WWII. Whereas Moore's superheroes were forced into retirement, here the heroes succumb to disillusionment, personality flaws and even madness. Robinson unpersuasively projects the dark pessimism of 1990s superhero comics onto the idealistic, committed heroes of half a century before. One of these "mystery men," Tex Thompson, alias the Americommando, enters politics and initiates a government project that uses atomic power to create Dynaman, a "superman" who becomes a living weapon against the Soviets. Beneath their patriotic rhetoric, Thompson and Dynaman conspire to become dictators. But Robinson never explains why the "greatest generation" that just defeated fascism abroad would embrace a homegrown version. By revealing that Thompson's and Dynaman's identities have been usurped by impostors, Robinson shies away from demonstrating how an American superhero could morph into a neo-Nazi <i>�bermensch</i>. Smith's realistic artwork and mastery of gesture and facial expression bring out all the dramatic potential in Robinson's scenario. But Darwyn Cooke's recent <i>The New Frontier</i> paints a more convincing postwar portrait of DC's superheroes. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Beevor&#39;s hands, Arnhem becomes a study of national character. -- Ben Macintyre * The Times * Antony Beevor&#39;s magnificent account. . . Beevor&#39;s skill lies in his ability to recreate the tumultuous brutality of battle. . .

Aficionados of military history will revel in Beevor&#39;s microscopic detail, with every skirmish given its rightful place. . .

The beauty is in the details. . . . This gripping book, with its tightly focused timescale and subject matter, shows him once again at his very best. -- Keith Lowe * Literary Review * Another masterwork from the most feted military historian of our time. . . Does the story need to be retold? Beevor is such a good writer, with a gift for clarity and a knack for the telling personal portrait, that the answer is undoubtedly yes. -- Jay Elwes * Prospect Magazine * Our greatest chronicler of the Second World War . . . The drama of manoeuvre and counter-thrust, the courage and cowardice of soldier and civilian, the follies and vanities of commanders, which are especially rich in this story, are deployed with colour and humanity. His fans will love it. -- Robert Fox * Evening Standard * As Antony Beevor showed in Stalingrad, he is a master of his craft as a military historian. . . We have here a definitive account of one of the most painful episodes of the Second World War. -- Piers Paul Read * The Tablet * It is, in short, a chapter of the Second World War that was crying out for the storytelling talents of Sir Antony Beevor, arguably the finest narrative historian of his generation. This is the result - and his many fans will not be disappointed . . .

Heinz: A Library of America Special Publication</h2><p><b>Bill Littlefield (NPR's <i>Only a Game</i>) presents the second installment in the Library of America series devoted to classic American sportswriters, a defintive collector&#x2019;s edition of the pathbreaking writer who invented the long-form sports story. </b>Like his friend and admirer Red Smith, W. C. Heinz (1915&#x2013;2008) was one of the most distinctive and&nbsp; influential sportswriters of the last century. Though he began his career as a newspaper reporter, Heinz soon moved beyond the confines of the daily column, turning freelance and becoming the first sportwriter to make his living writing for magazines. In doing so he effectively invented the long-form sports story, perfecting a style that paved the way for the New Journalism of the 1960s. His profiles of the top athletes of his day still feel remarkably current, written with a freshness of perception, a gift for characterization, and a finely tuned ear for dialogue. Jimmy Breslin named Heinz&#x2019;s &#x201c;Brownsville Bum&#x201d;&#x2014;a brief life of Al &#x201c;Bummy&#x201d; Davis, Brooklyn street tough and onetime welterweight champion of the world&#x2014;&#x201c;the greatest magazine sports story I&#x2019;ve ever read, bar none.&#x201d; His spare and powerful 1949 column, &#x201c;Death of a Race Horse,&#x201d; has been called a literary classic, a work of clarity and precision comparable to Hemingway at his best.<br><br>Now, for this essential writer&#x2019;s centennial, Bill Littlefield, the host of NPR&#x2019;s Only A Game, presents the essential Heinz: thirty-eight columns, profiles, and memoirs from the author&#x2019;s personal archive, including eighteen pieces never collected during his lifetime. Though Heinz&#x2019;s great passion was boxing&#x2014;the golden era of Rocky Graziano, Floyd Patterson, and Sugar Ray Robinson&#x2014;his interests extended to the wide world of sports, with indelible profiles of baseball players (Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio), jockeys (George Woolf, Eddie Arcaro), hockey players, football coaches, scouts and trainers and rodeo riders.</p><p>BILL LITTLEFIELD, a nationally known author and veteran sports commentator, has been the host of National Public Radio&#x2019;s weekly sports program <i>Only A Game</i> since it began in 1993.

(Anne Lamott)</b></p><p>In 2011, when she was in her late fifties, beloved author and journalist Joyce Maynard met the first true partner she had ever known. Jim wore a rakish hat over a good head of hair; he asked real questions and gave real answers; he loved to see Joyce shine, both in and out of the spotlight; and he didn&#x2019;t mind the mess she made in the kitchen. He was not the husband Joyce imagined, but he quickly became the partner she had always dreamed of.</p><p>Before they met, both had believed they were done with marriage, and even after they married, Joyce resolved that no one could alter her course of determined independence. Then, just after their one-year wedding anniversary, her new husband was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During the nineteen months that followed, as they battled his illness together, she discovered for the first time what it really meant to be a couple--to be a true partner and to have one.</p><p>This is their story. Charting the course through their whirlwind romance, a marriage cut short by tragedy, and Joyce&#x2019;s return to singleness on new terms, <i>The Best of Us </i>is a heart-wrenching, ultimately life-affirming reflection on coming to understand true love through the experience of great loss.</p></p><p><b>Joyce Maynard</b> is the author of sixteen books including the novels <i>To Die For</i> and <i>Labor Day</i> (both adapted for film) and the bestselling memoir <i>At Home in the World</i>. Her essays and columns have appeared in dozens of publications and numerous collections. She is a frequent performer with The Moth, a fellow of the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo, and founder of the Lake Atitlan Writers' Workshop. She is the mother of three grown children, and makes her home in Lafayette, California.<p>"<i>The Best of Us</i> remind[s] readers to let go of superficial concerns and embrace a deeper appreciation for our lives and the people in them . . . Perhaps with 'The Best of Us,' 'Maynard' will come to have new definitions: Maynard (verb) 1. To find love later in life. 2. To do anything possible to help a loved one in crisis. 3. To let oneself be changed by love. 4. To write movingly about it all." - <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"This haunting story, penned by a master wordsmith, is a reminder to savor every loved one and every day." - starred review, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"In this touching memoir, Maynard (<i>To Die For; At Home in the World</i>) chronicles her second marriage. She beautifully renders the joy of falling in love later in life and the pain of watching her husband die of pancreatic cancer. Maynard's heartfelt story will resonate with those who have lost loved ones." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Joyce Maynard has been through so many ups and downs in her life and she communicates her love, pain and everything in between through her life affirming experiences, written with great emotion and clarity in this beautiful memoir. I highly recommend it." - <i>BookTrib</i></p><p>"Maynard shows us her flaws, her exuberance, her willingness to take risks, to fall in love, and happily, finally, to discover what a mature marriage and loving relationship look like &#x2015; flaws, cancer and all. Her readers will do more than connect; they will laugh, cry and rekindle hope that the best of us just might be possible." - <i>Charleston Post Courier</i></p><p>"There isn't a happy ending, but their journey is a beautiful one nonetheless." - <i>Bustle</i></p><p>"Joyce Maynard's memoir <i>The Best of Us--</i>about her adored second husband--is brutally honest and deeply loving." - <i>Woman's Day</i></p><p>"The famed novelist and memoirist on meeting the love of her life, marrying, and facing loss." - <i>The Philadelphia Tribune, "Fall's Big Books"</i></p><p>"Joyce Maynard shares the heart-wrenching but ultimately hopeful story of finding love only to lose it a short time later in <i>The Best of Us </i>(Bloomsbury). - <i>Parade, '4 Riveting Reads to Try This Fall'"</i></p><p>"[Maynard] delivers a moving tribute to [her husband's] memory and a thoughtful exploration of the connection between love and loss." - <i>The San Jose Mercury News, "Books by the Bay"</i></p><p><i>"The Best of Us </i>feels like a life come full circle, addressing a much more adult kind of love." - <i>Signature Reads</i></p><p>"Joyce Maynard is getting up close and personal in <i>The Best of Us</i>." - <i>7x7</i></p><p>"The memoir is not about death so much as it is about finding in the deep shadows of illness obvious things, like appreciating time with loved ones and the value of dying at home and not in hospital. Importantly, it has Maynard discovering confidence, nobility, dignity and her best self." - <i>The San Jose Mercury News</i></p><p>"Maynard as caretaker is a revelation, both beautiful and heart-wrenching--a role she undertakes (as everything grows harder) with grit, grace and growth. Her earlier memoirs may have had their naysayers, but no one can naysay <i>The Best of Us."</i> - <i>The Buffalo News</i></p><p><i>"The Best of Us</i> is both heartbreaking and uplifting, a chronicle of unlikely, unexpected romance and personal tragedy, as well as a meditation on the nature of love." - <i>Omnivoracious</i></p><p>"In her poignant memoir about losing her husband to cancer, Maynard reminds readers to embrace a deeper appreciation for our lives and the people in them." - Best Books of the Year 2017, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p><i>"The Best of Us </i>is so candid, so deeply moving, so powerful . . . a testament to human resilience. Joyce Maynard is unfathomably heroic." - Joyce Carol Oates</p><p>"I love this new work. I think it is the most important writing of her life--profound, heart wrenching, inspiring, full of joy and tears and life." - Anne Lamott</p><p>"Joyce has captured her all too brief time with Jim in <i>The Best of Us</i> with her characteristic honesty and with so much love that my heart broke and soared on every page. Everyone needs to read this book." - Ann Hood</p><p>"Filled with passion and humor and beauty and aching sadness, <i>The Best of Us</i> gets at the heart of what love is: a willingness to open your heart completely to another person despite the risk of heartbreak." - Christina Baker Kline</p><p>"Maynard's lyrical, moving, break-your-heart memoir will make you love a little harder, appreciate each second a little more, and shake your world in the best of ways." - Caroline Leavitt</p><p>"This fiercely honest book is as much about life as it is about death. We understand the magnitude of Maynard&#x2019;s loss because she has shown us the magnitude of her gain: the transformative joy of finding love in her late fifties. I could not stop turning the pages." - Anne Fadiman</p><p>"Joyce Maynard's memoir of life, death, and love is written with honesty, intimacy and a generosity of spirit that left me weeping, and in awe. I loved it." - Abigail Thomas</p><p><i>"The Best of Us </i>is shattering in the best possible sense. With exquisite honesty, bravery, and large-heartedness, Joyce Maynard gives us a love story that we read breathlessly, even though we know how it will end. This is a beautiful story about the complexity of ever daring to adore another human being. I was moved and transfixed." - Dani Shapiro</p><p>"Oh! This book! Tender, insightful, ruminative, soaring. To find such love and then to lose it, and to capture so much of its beauty on the meager page--Joyce Maynard alchemizes life-numbing pain into dazzling prose." - Hope Edelman</p></p><h2>Mr. Willowby&#39;s Christmas Tree</h2><p>A poem about a Christmas tree that was too big to fit in Mr. Willowby&#39;s parlor</p><p>Mr. Willowby, the unwitting hero of this Christmas classic, looks quite a bit like the little mustachioed mascot from Monopoly. But as befits a Yuletide tale, this diminutive millionaire turns out to be a good bit more generous.<p> The Christmas tree in question shows up at Mr. Willowby's home by special order, aboard a big pink truck: "Full and fresh and glistening green--The biggest tree he had ever seen." But it's just a little <i>too</i> big, so he asks his butler, Baxter, to trim off the top few feet that brush up against the parlor ceiling. Baxter realizes that this snipped-off top would make a perfect little tree for "Miss Adelaide, Mr. Willowby's upstairs maid." But she, too, must clip off the top of her tree... which then ends up with Timm, the gardener. Timm's trimming goes on to Barnaby Bear, the tippy-top of Barnaby's tree ends up with Frisky Fox and family, and then Benjamin Rabbit finds the top few inches that Mrs. Fox snipped off. And so it goes, until soon the whole countryside learns that it's simply "grand to have a tree--Exactly like Mr. Willowby."</p><p> There's many a lesson to be taken from this tale, about recycling and supply-side economics just for starters. But the cheerful illustrations of Robert Barry ensure that you'll have fun just watching as the ever-tinier tree gets passed on to ever-tinier families. (Ages 5 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Mr. Willowby's Christmas tree<p></p><p>Came by special delivery.</p><p></p><p>Full and fresh and glistening green--</p><p></p><p>The biggest tree he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>That was the trouble. Mr. Willowby's Christmas tree was so tall, it couldn't stand up straight in his parlor. Mr. Willowby asked his butler to chop off the top of the tree. What happens to the treetop? Where will it be for Christmas?</p></p><h2>A Long Walk Up the Water Slide: A Neal Carey Mystery</h2><p>If there's anything Neal Carey should know by now, it's this: Never open the door if a one-armed man might be standing on the other side. Because that man is bound to be his very own "Dad," Joe Graham, who will only sniff at his housekeeping and make him an offer he'd better not refuse.<br>But maybe falling in love has softened Neal's instincts, because before he knows it, Graham is in his kitchen, and Neal is embarking upon a job with a new twist. This time he doesn't have to find someone, he has to keep someone from being found - and clean up her act in the process<br>From Austin to Las Vegas to San Antonio, Neal and his charge are on the lam and engaged in a constant battle of wits to keep from killing each other, before someone else does the job for them.</p><p>DON WINSLOW is the author of thirteen books and has also written for film and television. On his way to becoming a writer, he did a number of things to make a living -- private investigator, safari guide, actor, and theater director, among others. His first novel, <i>A Cool Breeze on the Underground</i> (Book 1 in the Neal Carey Mysteries), was nominated for an Edgar Award, and <i>California Fire and Life</i> received the Shamus Award. He now lives in Southern California.A change of pace for Neal Carey, who's been petulantly hunting down people for the Friends of the Family (Way Down on the High Lonely, 1993, etc.). This time, Joe Graham and the other Friends want him to keep much-hunted Polly Paget under wraps in the Nevada desert while he cleans up her grammar, her diction, and her act before she goes on network TV to denounce her boss, Jackson Landis, founder and majority owner of the Family Cable Network, as a rapist. The real change, though, is in the tone of this caper. Neal's intellectually elitist mysticism wouldn't cut it as Polly's pursued by (1) a former FBI agent working for Jackson Landis and Candy, his wife and partner in a new theme park to be called (of course) Candyland; (2) a porn prince eager to sign Polly to a centerfold contract; (3) an unsavory developer who whitewashes his silent partnership in Candyland by going to confession every day; and (4) a hit man whose obsessive professionalism can't hide the fact that he keeps missing the target. So Winslow wisely shuffles Neal offstage for long, foolishly amusing stretches while Candy tracks down Polly and bonds with her; the senior Friends, learning that the New Orleans mob is moving in on Jack's empire, tiptoe away from backing Polly; and all parties concerned scramble to come out on top in a final tarantella worthy of Donald E. Westlake. Not as distinctive as Neal's earlier adventures, but the broadest, loosest, funniest of them all. It's great to see Neal taking a break from his M.A. thesis on that stinker Smollett without getting all hung up for a change. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Across the march of thirty centuries, Tuchman brings to life the dramatic events which constitute folly&#39;s hallmark in government; the fall of Troy, symbolic prototype of freely chosen disaster; the Protestant secession, provoked by six decades of spectacularly corrupt papcy; the British forfeiture of the American colonies; and America&#39;s catastrophic thirty year involvement with vietnam.</p><p>Barbara Tuchman defines folly as "Pursuit of Policy Contrary to Self-Interest." In THE MARCH OF FOLLY, Tuchman examines 4 conflicts: The Trojan Horse, The Protestant Secession, The American Revolution, and The American War in Vietnam. In each example an alternative course of action was available, the actions were endorsed by a group, not just an individual leader, and the actions were perceived as counter productive in their own time. Many individuals are guilty of folly (Tuchman also calls this woodenheadedness), but when governments persist in folly, their actions can adversely affect thousands, even millions of lives. Folly is a child of power. "The power to command frequently causes failure to think."(p.32). THE MARCH OF FOLLY may not be as well known as A DISTANT MIRROR and THE GUNS OF AUGUST, but it is my favorite of her works. I heartily recommend it to any Tuchman fans who have not yet discovered it.<br><br>Randy Hickernell<br>Ballantine sales reper of the Pulitzer Prize, author Barbara Tuchman now tackles the pervasive presence of folly in governments through the ages. Defining folly as the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interersts, despite the availability of feasible alternatives, Tuchman details four decisive turning points in history that illustrate the very heights of folly in government: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by the Renaissance Popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain&#39;s George III, and the United States&#39; persistent folly in Vietnam. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings the people, places, and events of history magnificently alive for today&#39;s reader.</p><h2>No Laughing Matter: An Inspector Luke Thanet Mystery</h2><p>Inspector Luke Thanet investigates the grisly death of Zak Randish, winemaker and owner of the Sturrenden Vineyard, whose jugular vein was severed when he was forced through a window pane.</p><p>Dorothy Simpson worked as a French teacher and then marriage guidance counsellor before writing full-time. She won the Crime Writers&#39; Association&#39;s Silver Dagger Award in 1985. She is married with three children and lives near Maidstone, Kent, the background to the Thanet novels.". . .Unlike the living, the dead have no means of safeguarding their secrets," thinks detective inspector Luke Thanet in his 12th case, while viewing the corpse of vintner Zak Randish. The victim's jugular vein was severed when he was shoved through a window of his winery's laboratory, the scene of considerable violence. Thanet bypasses such mundane stuff as physical evidence (he has only one suspect's shoes checked for broken glass and we never learn the result), preferring instead to dig deeply into the dead man's unsavory past. Uncovering wife-beating and crass womanizing for starters, Thanet finds an ugly secret under each overturned stone, exposing the last secret, a real shocker, that leads to a stunning outcome. Adding dimension to the picture are leisurely looks at Thanet's daughter Bridget's unhappy romance, peripheral characters' battles with anorexia, dyslexia, leukemia and post-partum depression and the difficulties of British winemakers, struggling along without "any of the grants the French and Germans get." Simpson ( Wake the Dead ) has written an absorbing tale, but much of the action takes place offstage.

The Jefferson Lecture is a tribute to McCullough's lifetime investigation of history. <br> In this short speech, this master historian tracks his fascination with all things historical to his early days in Pittsburgh where he "learned to love history by way of books" in bookshops and at the local library. <br> McCullough eloquently leads us through the founding fathers' attraction to history, letting us in on his composition of 1776 as well as the Pulitzer Prize winning John Adams. His obvious affection for history is inspiring, because it encompasses the whole reach of the human drama. In McCullough's able hands, history truly "is a larger way of looking at life."</p><p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams</i>, and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

Visit DavidMcCullough.com.In a 2003 speech given in Washington, D.C., author David McCullough reminds listeners that history is made up of human beings, not gods. He cites the flaws of the Founding Fathers as he ticks off their accomplishments. One of his favorite points to stress is their love of books and literature; [Nathan Hale's] famous speech before being hanged, for example, comes from CATO, a play popular at the time. McCullough reads as a master lecturer as he discusses the Founders, then turns personal as he discusses his own love of books, which started with a copy of AMOS AND ME, a children's book about Benjamin Franklin. Book-lovers, especially those with an interest in history, will enjoy hearing how books teach us about the past--and present.

I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time&#x2013;or perhaps I simply wasn&#x2019;t ready to accept it&#x2013;but my friend was dying. <br><br>Sala Burton was a Congresswoman from California whom I had known, along with her late husband, Phillip, for many years. She was one of the women I admired most, as well as a close friend.<br><br>Everyone respected Sala and knew not to underestimate her. She looked like Mother Earth; she spoke with a Polish accent; she didn&#x2019;t drive a car. She gave off an intense warmth&#x2013;if she liked you. She was passionate about what she believed in, but very dispassionate about her<br>politics.<br><br>Sala was like family to me. She loved my children and was especially close to my two oldest daughters, Nancy Corinne and Christine. Nancy Corinne started at Mount Vernon College in Washington shortly after Sala went to Congress, and called us one day to say that she needed<br>a car.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you think you should have a car in college?&#x201d; my husband, Paul, and I asked. With five children, providing each one with a car in college was not in the budget. &#x201c;I need a car for Sala,&#x201d; Nancy Corinne said. &#x201c;I have to drive Sala around.&#x201d;<br><br>So we sent our old Jeep Wrangler from San Francisco. It was quite a sight to see Nancy Corinne driving the dignified Sala Burton around Washington in a car with removable windows.<br><br>A couple of years later, Sala became ill with cancer. We thought she could win any battle. But this was one she could not.<br><br>And so the time came to say goodbye. Anyone who has ever visited a friend who is dying will know how hard it is. What was astonishing to me, however, was her selflessness. Despite my protests, what she wanted most to talk about was me.<br><br>A circle of her friends, whom she had summoned, gathered around her bed. Solemnly she announced the sad news: She would not be seeking reelection because she was very ill. She then turned to me and asked me to run for her seat. She wanted me to accept her endorsement<br>on the spot.<br><br>&#x201c;Sala, please don&#x2019;t talk this way,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re breaking my heart.&#x201d;<br><br>I still held out hope that she would get better. Finally she convinced me that my agreement was the only answer that would bring her comfort, and so, with great sadness, I promised I would run for Congress. <br><br>I often look back on that day in wonder.<br><br>We all admired Sala&#x2019;s strength and grace, but what was striking was the faith she had in me. Sometimes it takes the encouragement of someone who knows us well to propel us forward in ways we never would have dreamed. I was confident in my abilities and accomplishments, but Sala&#x2019;s faith in me was so unshakable that it made me determined to live up to it.<br><br>And so I ran for Congress&#x2013;and won. I was forty-seven years old, a mother of five, happily married, and never&#x2013;not even once&#x2013;thinking or wanting this to happen to me. <br><br>In the campaign, I had to face many challenges. Like many women, I was hesitant to talk about myself and my achievements, but I became much more at ease because I believed deeply in everything I said about the issues. <br><br>What lifts you up, what helps you to grow, is the excitement of the people around you. When I announced my candidacy in mid-February that year, I walked into the ILWU union hall expecting to see a few friends and reporters; instead, there was a large, enthusiastic crowd. Their support made me determined to win, not just for myself but for all of them.<br><br>Twenty years later, as I was sworn in as the first woman Speaker of the House, faith again was very much on my mind. I thought of all the women throughout American history who&#x2019;d had faith that one day we would achieve equality with men.<br><br>As I accepted the gavel from Republican Leader John Boehner, I told my colleagues:<br><br>&#x201c;This is an historic moment&#x2013;for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited over two hundred years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights.<br><br>&#x201c;But women weren&#x2019;t just waiting; they were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling. . . .<br><br>&#x201c;We have made history, now let us make progress.&#x201d;<br><b>2<br></b><i>D e c l a ra t i o n s o f I n d e p e n d e n c e<br></i><br>I&#x2019;ll never forget the first time I saw the Capitol. It was on a cold January day in 1947, when I was six years old. The occasion was my father&#x2019;s swearing-in ceremony for his fifth term in Congress.<br>My brothers were excited. As our car approached the Capitol, they kept saying, &#x201c;Nancy, look at the Capitol.&#x201d; I said I didn&#x2019;t see any capitals. They insisted, and finally I asked, &#x201c;Is it a capital <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, or <i>C</i>?&#x201d; As we drove closer, my brother Joey turned my head toward the most amazing sight. <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t see the giant letters I expected. Instead, I saw a stunning building with a magnificent white dome. I still think it&#x2019;s the most beautiful building in the world because of what it represents: the voice of the people. <br><br>Whether to view it as the world&#x2019;s greatest symbol of democracy, to serve in it as a Representative of the people, or to preside over it as the Speaker of the House, any association with the Capitol is exciting.<br><br>To this day, I feel a strong connection to my father whenever I&#x2019;m on the floor of the House, imagining what it must have been like for him to be one of the earliest Italian Americans to serve there. My father, Thomas D&#x2019;Alesandro Jr., was a U.S. Congressman from Maryland,<br>first elected in 1938 as a New Deal Democrat loyal to FDR. He later served as the Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years. My mother, Nancy (Annunciata in Italian) Lombardi, so named because she was born on March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation, was my father&#x2019;s teammate<br>every step of the way.<br><br>Both of my parents were raised in Baltimore&#x2019;s Little Italy, as was I. My father&#x2019;s mother was born in Baltimore&#x2013;his grandparents were from Venice and Genoa. His father was from Abruzzi.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s father was born in Campobasso and her mother in Sicily. They met in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and raised their family in Baltimore.<br><br>It was into this large Italian American family that I was born, the only daughter after six sons. We were devoutly Catholic, deeply patriotic, proud of our Italian American heritage, and staunchly Democratic.<br><br>Those views were shared by our neighbors. Diversity in Little Italy was based on what part of Italy your family was from. Every region and food of Italy was represented in our neighborhood&#x2013;Genovese, Napolitano, Abruzzese, Veneziano, Romano, Piemontese, Toscano, Siciliano, and more. <br><br>Growing up in Little Italy impressed upon me the vitality immigrants bring to America. With their courage, optimism, and determination to make the future better for their families, they fulfill the American dream. They made America stronger. That has been true throughout American history, and it is true today.<br><br>My father was twenty-five and already a member of the Maryland State Legislature when he noticed a beautiful nineteen-year-old woman leaving St. Leo&#x2019;s Church one Sunday morning. He followed her down the street and, when she stopped at a corner, went up to her and asked for a date.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s response was to tell the dapper legislator that she didn&#x2019;t know who he was and that she would not go out on a date unless her grandmother approved. Hence Daddy&#x2019;s courtship of Mommy&#x2019;s grandmother. <br><br>Apparently he passed inspection because my mother and he were married in a wedding that was a traffic stopping event in Baltimore. All of the members of the Baltimore Police and Fire Departments were invited. <br><br>Daddy&#x2019;s introduction to government began at the age of eight, when his mother took him to the 1912 Democratic Convention, not far from their home in Little Italy. I can imagine Daddy&#x2019;s thrill at hearing the roars coming from inside the Fifth Regiment Armory, where William Jennings Bryan nominated the soon-to-be President Woodrow Wilson, who won the nomination on the forty-sixth ballot.<br><br>When he was old enough to vote, my father cast his first vote ever for himself in a successful election to the Maryland House of Delegates. He went from there to the Baltimore City Council and then on to Congress before serving as Mayor.<br><br>My father was a phenomenal natural politician, handsome, and charismatic. With his piercing blue eyes, pencil thin moustache, and trademark polka-dot bow ties, he cut a dashing figure. He was a talented dancer and a brilliant orator. Although he did not have much formal education, he was clever and determined. He was very knowledgeable in a number of areas, especially public policy.<br><br>Except for his earliest years in politics, my mother was his partner. She was smart, and she had a sense of justice that became a driving force in our family&#x2019;s life. I often think she was born fifty years too soon. The truth is that my father and the times held her back.<br><br>Now, my father was a wonderful man with an enormous heart, very charming and smart, very loyal, a public servant in the truest sense. While he was forward-thinking and progressive, and appreciated the growing role women were playing in politics, he was bound by the old traditions when it came to his own family. My father did not even want me to cut my long hair when I was a young teenager.<br><br>My mother was a wonderful wife and parent, and she was also an entrepreneur and a visionary. She started law school but had to stop when three of her sons had whooping<br>cough at the same time.

Tim Blanning depicts the lives of ordinary people and the dominant personalities of the age (Louis XIV, Frederick the Great, Napoleon), and explores an era of almost unprecedented change, growth and cultural, political and technological ferment that shaped the societies and economies of entire countries.</p><p>Tim Blanning is the author of a number of major works on eighteenth century Europe, including The Pursuit of Glory : Europe 1648-1815, The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture and Joseph II. He is Emeritus Professor of Modern European History at the University of Cambridge, a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and a Fellow of the British Academy. His latest book, Frederick the Great, won the British Academy Medal 2016.<i>Starred Review.</i> This new volume in the Penguin History of Europe series is a wonderful achievement, particularly so considering the mammoth amount of specialist material that required synthesizing into digestible portions for general consumption. Blanning, professor of modern history at the University of Cambridge, has performed the miracle of balancing and blending traditional political and diplomatic accounts with the newer fields of social, economic and intellectual history. A prime example of this is the author's treatment of the impact of the new "public sphere." As people discoursed through coffeehouses, Masonic organizations or periodicals, "a new source of authority emerged to challenge the opinion-makers of the old regime: public opinion." Countries where this public sphere was left free, as in Britain or the Dutch Republic, tended to be more politically stable than, say, France, where suppression ended in bloody revolution. Blanning narrates the story of Europe from the end of the Thirty Years' War to the end of the Napoleonic wars, when secularization and the primacy of state sovereignty were recognized as the key attributes of the coming era. What the Europeans would eventually get was the secular, martial religion of nationalism. But this is the subject for a subsequent volume&#x2014;which will be hard-pressed to match this splendid one. <i>(June 4)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

On a special night out, Kim takes Seldon to his favorite fast-food restaurant for a feast of burgers and fries. But the good time turns to tragedy: the young boy becomes gravely ill and dies as a result of poisoning by <b>E. coli.</b> bacteria found in the meat.Was Seldon's death a result of shoddy food-handling practices? Or was it a sophisticated case of product tampering - by a rival fast-foot giant or a disgruntled employee? Or perhaps by someone with a score to settle with Kim? Taking a leave from his surgical practice, Kim devotes his energies to solving the mystery full time. But he immediately hits a brick walls: a code of silence more impenetrable than anything he has ever encountered in his medical career. Instead of a cold-shoulder reception, however, Kim is soon met with a boot and a fist as thugs attempt to quash his inquiry.Aided by his ex-wife, Kim pursues a trail of deadly evidence, uncovering complicity and guilt stretching from the slaughterhouse floor to the corporate boardroom. Racing against time before more are poisoned, the two come face-to-face with the shocking and elusive truth. And in their life-and-death search for answers, they rediscover the reasons they first fell in love. With trademark pulse-pounding flair, <b>Robin Cook</b> delivers a cutting-edge thriller, borrowing from today's fears and tomorrow's medical technology.</p><p>Just when you thought it was safe to eat a hamburger again, Robin Cook--master of medical mysteries, deadly epidemics, and creepy comas--returns with an all too likely villain drawn right from current headlines: the American meat industry. If you've ever wondered where the E. coli bacteria comes from, and exactly how it can ravage the human body, destroying everything in its path, this is the book for you. As usual, Cook delivers solid information, well-researched medical arcana, and a scathing indictment of managed health care. <p> His protagonist, Kim Regis, is an all-too-typical ego-driven surgeon, whose arrogance and invulnerability set him up to be brought low by the deadly toxin that takes the life of his young daughter. Sparing no time and barely a paragraph to reflect on his loss, Regis goes right after the culprit, a meat-packing behemoth that brings dead and diseased animals to the slaughterhouse, breaking every health regulation in the book. The scenes set on the killing floor and in the boning rooms will make a vegetarian out of the most confirmed red-meat eater. <i>Toxin</i> is a heart-pounding thriller that hits very close to home. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Dr. Robin Cook is the author of thirty previous books, most recently <em>Nano</em>, and is credited with popularizing the medical thriller with his wildly successful first novel, Coma.

Hansen here presents an encyclopedic discussion of all of the various nuclear explosives developed, tested, and used by the U. S. Department of Defense. Much of the material was declassified for this book, and Hansen emphasizes his opinion that the secrecy was and is unwarranted. He provides technical details of the physics concepts, as well as political and tactical justification for development of various individual warheads. Students maturing in a nuclear age may wish to be well informed about the sources of their possible destruction; they may also be curious about the scientific principles used to design the weapons. The thorough index and footnotes, as well as appropriate photos, charts, and diagrams make this title a useful one in schools with strong physics curricula .Jim Boyd, Episcopal High School, Bellaire<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This impressive sourcebook belongs with Michael Stephenson and Roger Hearn's Nuclear Case Book ( LJ 9/15/84) and Thomas B. Cochran et al.'s Nuclear Weapons Databook ( LJ 2/15/84). (The former is more philosophically oriented; the latter has data on a larger number of weapons.) Hansen's is the best on World War II developments and after. Especially good are his accounts of Pacific testing after the war; hydrogen bomb development; and missiles, safety devices, fuses, etc. An excellent, understandable section on the nuclear physics of the bombs makes this good for informed readers.

There she witnessed the full impact of the war and first formed the ambition to write an account of what history - the great political events driven by men of power, wealth, and ambition - does when it reaches the realm of ordinary people struggling for life and bread. <br>The central character in this powerful and unforgiving novel is Ida Mancuso, a schoolteacher whose husband has died and whose feckless teenage son treats the war as his playground. A German soldier on his way to North Africa rapes her, falls in love with her, and leaves her pregnant with a boy whose survival becomes Ida's passion. <br>Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood. We catch glimpses of bombing raids, street crimes, a cattle car from which human cries emerge, an Italian soldier succumbing to frostbite on the Russian front, the dumb endurance of peasants who have lived their whole lives with nothing and now must get by with less than nothing. <p>"One of the few novels in any language that renders the full horror of Hitler's war, the war that never gets into the books . . ."-- Alfred Kazan, "Esquire <br>"A storyteller who spellbinds."-- Stephen Spender, "The New York Review of Books <br>"A marvel of a novel . . . all the pleasures that fiction can offer."-- Doris Grumbach, "Saturday Review</p>Born in Rome in 1918, Morante was married to the writer Alberto Moravia. During the last years of World War II, the couple were refugees in the countryside near Cassino. Her first novel, MENZOGNA E SORTILEGIO (1948) was a critical success and won the Viareggio Prize. She was not a prolific writer, with L&#39;ISOLA DI ARTURO appearing nearly ten years later. At the time of publication in 1974 HISTORY was called the novel of the century.

Powell examines the rise and fall of the controversial Desert Rock Power Plant initiative in New Mexico to trace the political conflicts surrounding native sovereignty and contemporary energy development on Navajo (Din�) Nation land. Powell's historical and ethnographic account shows how the coal-fired power plant project's defeat provided the basis for redefining the legacies of colonialism, mineral extraction, and environmentalism. Examining the labor of activists, artists, politicians, elders, technicians, and others, Powell emphasizes the generative potential of Navajo resistance to articulate a vision of autonomy in the face of twenty-first-century colonial conditions. Ultimately, Powell situates local Navajo struggles over energy technology and infrastructure within broader sociocultural life, debates over global climate change, and tribal, federal, and global politics of extraction.</p><p>Dana E.

An almost wordless fantasy about a young family consisting of a mom, her two daughters, and an assortment of animals who get evicted from their farmhouse on Christmas Eve. In a parallel to the original Christmas story and the small family that had nowhere to go, this odd group makes the best of a bad situation and takes up residence in an empty barn nearby. With good humor and determination, they march down the snowy path to the barn. The horses pull the grand piano (its flaming candelabra still lit) on skis, the dogs pull the bed (stuffed animals still arranged on it), and everyone gallops back for more. Everything goes: even the Santa and sleigh display from the yard, the decorated tree, and a toboggan carrying everything else, from the animals' food to the dryer (with the clothes still tumbling). And it's all moved in and set up, as the snow begins to fall, in plenty of time to celebrate the holiday. The beautiful oil paintings capture the cold, snow-swept, star-filled countryside as effectively as they portray the essence and personality of each character, human or animal. With Day's characteristic comic touches, realistic scenes are given a whimsical, at times almost absurd spin, and a jolly good time is had by all.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Green Woodwork: Working With Wood the Natural Way</h2><p>This item condition is New.

Nigel Saul demonstrates that Richards` aim was to exalt and dignify the crown, but in a period of faction and feud his tactical errors and contradictory policies resulted in deposition and assassination.</p><p>Nigel Saul paints a picture of Richard as a highly assertive and determined ruler, one whose key aim was to exalt and dignify the crown. In Richard&#39;s view, the crown was threatened by the factiousness of the nobility and the assertiveness of the common people. The king met these challenges by exacting obedience, encouraging lofty new forms of address and constructing an elaborate system of rule by bonds and oaths. Saul traces the sources of Richard&#39;s political ideas and finds that he was influenced by a deeply felt orthodox piety and by the ideas of the civil lawyers. He shows that, although Richard&#39;s kingship resembled that of other rulers of the period, unlike theirs, his reign ended in failure because of tactical errors and contradictions in his policies. For all that he promoted the image of a distant, all-powerful monarch, Richard II&#39;s rule was in practice characterised by faction and feud. The king was obsessed by the search for personal security: in his subjects, however, he bred only insecurity and fear.<b>Nigel Saul</b> is reader in Medieval History at Royal Holloway College, University of London.<br></p><h2>Dave Pelz&#39;s Damage Control: How to Avoid Disaster Scores</h2><p>&#34;All golfers, even the best ones, get into rough predicaments due to errant shots or bad breaks.

The collapsible walls that divided two of the conference rooms had just been moved aside, opening a theater barely large enough to hold the voices and the hundred bodies crowding in. Paul English stood behind a table, facing them.<br><br>He was tall, about six foot two, and no longer thin, though he didn&#x2019;t look fat, just big. He had a prominent jaw and a large face that in repose sometimes made one think of raptors, beaked with staring eyes. He still had a boyish quality as well, along with all his hair&#x2014;�dark with hints of Irish red, parted in the middle and curving slightly upward to either side, like water rising from a fountain. It was November 2012. It had been more than thirty years since Paul had taken Catholic Communion, and more than twenty since his last fistfight. The skinny kid with a hot temper and an attitude now practiced meditation. Traces of a Boston working-�class accent still surfaced now and then&#x2014;�&#x201c;cahn&#x2019;t&#x201d; for &#x201c;can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; drawr&#x201d; for &#x201c;draw,&#x201d; &#x201c;remembah.&#x201d; And he was still at risk for dropping what his assistant called &#x201c;f-�bombs&#x201d; in polite company. But these were like the fragments of a memory, buried under decades of experience and the transformations of success.<br><br>Paul had joined the world of software engineering some thirty years before, at a time when computers and software programs were becoming pervasive&#x2014;�an underlying part of everything, it seemed, and the source of a great deal of new commerce. It was the era that saw the rise of the personal computer, the Internet, the World Wide Web, the smartphone. An era with its own American success story, the story of the software entrepreneur, which begins in a garage instead of a log cabin. Capitalism had long depended on people with the ambition and daring&#x2014;�not to say greed and recklessness&#x2014;�to start their own companies. But lately, entrepreneurship had become a freshly exalted pursuit. It was a church, and Paul was now one of its bishops.<br><br>He was forty-�nine. The crowd standing before him in the conference room was on average decades younger. Like most of them, he had been a computer programmer and by his own account uncomfortable in many social settings&#x2014;�or, as he put it, &#x201c;shy.&#x201d; One engineer out there in the crowd remembered knowing Paul when they were both much younger, then seeing him again after losing touch for several years. &#x201c;He seemed different,&#x201d; the engineer said. &#x201c;He looked different, less nerdy. He seemed more cool.&#x201d;<br><br>Paul had worked at creating that kind of impression. At various times over the past ten years, for instance, he had asked fashion-�conscious women friends to advise him on his wardrobe. He didn&#x2019;t feel that he had shed all his &#x201c;shyness,&#x201d; but in this setting, anyway, he was a paragon of savoir faire. He had natural assets&#x2014;�his size, his prominent jaw, his hair. And here, of course, he was the boss.<br><br>When Paul was fired up, he spoke hyperbolically and very fast, dropping the g&#x2019;s at the ends of words, eliding phrases so that they sounded like one word. But today his performance was muted. When the voices in the room had quieted, he said, in an offhand tone, which seemed strangely at odds with the message: &#x201c;So I have a big announcement about the company that I want to tell you. We&#x2019;ve actually agreed to merge with Priceline.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd turned into doves. &#x201c;Ooooo,&#x201d; they said.<br><br>Priceline was a large holding company of online travel agencies, and Kayak was a small and unusual but very profitable travel site. Until recently it had done no booking. Rather, it was a comprehensive search engine for travel, often described as &#x201c;a Google&#x201d; for finding flights and hotels and rental cars.<br><br>Paul and a young businessman named Steve Hafner had �founded Kayak nine years ago, in 2004. Since then, many companies had offered to buy them out. But, Paul told the room, Priceline&#x2019;s offer was the only one with the right ingredients. First of all, the purchase price. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a one-�point-�eight-�billion-�dollar transaction,&#x201d; said Paul.<br><br>He made the translation: Kayak&#x2019;s stock was now worth $40 a share, $14 more than when the company had gone public four months ago, and $10 more than the current price. Paul didn&#x2019;t say this, but about half of the people on his team owned stock now worth at least $1 million, and some owned considerably more. Paul&#x2019;s was the largest take, some $120 million.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t dwell on the money. Many of the newer faces out there in front of him owned little or no stock. And Kayak&#x2019;s lawyers had warned him not to say too much, lest he give ammunition to the enemy lawyers who specialize in filing suits over the sales of big companies. Nuisance suits and regulatory agencies would probably delay the official closing of the deal, Paul said. In the meantime, things would go on here at Kayak just as usual. And not only in the meantime. This deal, Paul said, would put Kayak in position to become the strongest travel company in the United States and maybe even internationally. Priceline was rich and powerful. Its market capitalization was $32 billion. And&#x2014;�this was the most important thing, along with the sale price&#x2014;�it had a history of letting its subsidiaries run with complete independence. He and his co-founder, Steve Hafner, had never wanted to work for anyone else, and this deal would preserve both their autonomy and the team&#x2019;s. &#x201c;And I think we have a great team here. It&#x2019;s our team, it&#x2019;s our culture, we hire and fire as we want.&#x201d; There would be no layoffs. Kayak&#x2019;s managers wouldn&#x2019;t even have to attend regular meetings at Priceline. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still here and signed up,&#x201d; Paul said. &#x201c;Steve is still here and signed up.&#x201d;<br><br>He spoke these last words in a tone so different from his usual exuberance it made you wonder if he believed them himself. He didn&#x2019;t seem unhappy about the news he&#x2019;d delivered&#x2014;�that Kayak, their creation, was now owned by a huge corporation&#x2014;�but he didn&#x2019;t seem in a mood to celebrate either.<br><br>Evening comes early in New England&#x2019;s November. The windows in the office were darkening by the time the meeting ended. Many of Paul&#x2019;s team, it appeared, couldn&#x2019;t wait to take the good news home. The team&#x2019;s most senior engineer had brought in a five-�hundred-�dollar bottle of Scotch, and several colleagues lingered in the aisles beside their desks, passing the bottle around. Paul sat at his computer, his broad back slightly hunched as he wrote &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; again and again to the congratulatory emails filling his screen.<br><br>2<br><br>Paul had situated Kayak&#x2019;s engineering office in the town of Concord, Massachusetts, just a few miles from the Old North Bridge, where the Revolutionary War began. But the immediate environs were a suburban office park, the kind of place you imagine being torn down even while it is being built. Paul almost always went in the back way, across a parking lot, into a brick building, up two flights of stairs, and through a gray metal door.<br><br>Business matters were handled by Steve Hafner in an office in Connecticut. The engineering office was Paul&#x2019;s creation and domain. It occupied two floors, all but identical and connected by a broad stairway. Paul and his architect had designed both floors in the open-�room, tidy-�industrial style: no private offices; conference rooms with glass walls; heating ducts and pipes left exposed in the high ceilings; everything gray or white with splashes of orange here and there. Most of the floors were filled with gray metal desks, arranged in complex, adjoining geometries. About a hundred people sat at them, in ergonomic office chairs, in front of large-�screen, late-model iMac computers. They could have been mistaken for a class of high school seniors, with a lot of thirty-� and forty-�year-�old faculty mixed in. Only one was African American. There were many Asian faces and East Indian faces. Collectively, Paul&#x2019;s crew spoke twenty-�one different languages. There was a smattering of women, three of them managers of teams and fourteen others carrying the title of engineer&#x2014;�a large percentage for a software company. The women were all better dressed than the men, who were a motley-�looking bunch. Jeans and T-�shirts predominated. Two engineers wore shorts and flip-�flops in all seasons. There were shaved heads, beards, a ponytail, a funny hat with earmuffs. One fellow wore his pants too high for fashion anywhere outside a nursing home. Some were thin, and pale as the winter light from their computer screens. Most were programmers. Looking across the sea of desks, Paul could pick out several dozen whom he affectionately described as odd&#x2014;�&#x201c;on the spectrum somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>He used the term loosely and with fellow feeling. He himself had been subject to a diagnosis: In his twenties, as a young programmer, he had been told that he suffered from &#x201c;bipolar disorder.&#x201d; None of the young engineers at Kayak knew this, but the condition still loomed over him, and sometimes descended upon him. What his team did know about their boss was that he could seem like a force field of energy, and many if not all were drawn to that energy and lifted by it. At the same time, Paul had made this office into something like a bastion against the mad, work-�all-�night ethos that he had reveled in back in his own coding days&#x2014;�days of hundred-�hour weeks. Kayak engineering was almost always empty on evenings and weekends. One new programmer who hadn&#x2019;t known any better and worked there all night had been told, when found out in the morning, &#x201c;Well, okay. But go home soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Paul had arranged various amenities for his team: modernist paintings, which hung near the sofa where visitors sometimes awaited appointments; a kitchen with free drinks and snacks; two coffee bars with expensive espresso makers; a rec room with a foosball table and a pool table and a kegerator, available to anyone at any time but mainly used for &#x201c;beer-�thirty&#x201d; on Friday afternoons. These perks were modest by the standards of established high-�tech companies. On the other hand, the atmosphere at Concord seemed unusually informal. Some other companies in the software business, especially large successful ones, walled themselves in with their secrets, like dragons hoarding their gold and jewels. Here, there were no Keep �Out signs on outer doors, no cameras patrolling the interior, no identity cards for employees to show to a scanner, and, for visitors, no nondisclosure forms to sign, not even a sign-�in sheet.</p><h2>Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess (Girl Genius)</h2><p>Intrigue!

As a Galician Jew, not to mention a biting social critic, Roth knew that life under the Dual Monarchy was not exactly flawless. Yet he retained a deep attachment to the old regime, which must have looked more and more civilized as the Nazis came to power. In 1933 he fled to Paris, where he commenced a slow, alcoholically induced suicide--managing, however, to write several more books, of which <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> was the last to appear.<p> Like so many of Roth's novels, this one is a celebration of Vienna in its pre-<i>Anschluss</i> days--during the 1870s, to be precise. "At this time," we're informed, "the world was deeply and frivolously at peace." In keeping with the frivolity, perhaps, Roth puts a fairy-tale-like spin on his memories. He opens <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> with a state visit by the Shah of Iran, transforming historical fact into whimsical fiction. And once he shifts the narrative to Vienna proper, his characters make their entrances and exits with brilliant, dreamlike rapidity. It would be tempting to compare the entire story--which revolves around the seduction and abandonment of the prostitute Mizzi Schinagl by the boneheaded Baron Taittinger--to a puppet show. But these puppets are capable of registering deep pain and transformation. Taittinger, for example, gets to utter the first honest sentence of his adult life: "He had caught himself telling the truth; and for the first time in many years he blushed, the way he had once blushed as a boy when he'd been caught telling a lie." And even Mizzi, the flattest character in a book full of wafer-thin ones, has her moments of electrifying humanity: </p><blockquote> She became terribly sad. Her simple soul was briefly illumined, indirectly and at a lower wattage, by the light that makes older and wiser people so happy and so sad: the light of understanding. She understood the sorrow and futility of everything. </blockquote> Roth, too, understood that sorrow. But in <i>The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i>, which has been beautifully translated by Michael Hofmann, he counters its gravitational pull with small, stunning perceptions and a kind of bemused decency. Indeed, Roth the novelist has precisely the "calculating kindliness" he ascribes to one Herr Efrussi--and this, he goes on to point out, is "the only sort that doesn't wreak destruction on this earth." <i>--James Marcus</i>Joseph Roth (1894-1939) was one of the greatest novelists of the twentieth century, a versatile writer of extraordinary range who was able to capture cross-sections of entire societies. Written in exile shortly before the Nazi annexation of Roth's native Austria, <i> The Tale of the 1002nd Night</i> could not be published in Germany until well after the fall of the Third Reich; it appears now in English for the first time, one of the last major novels by Roth to be translated for English-language readers. <p><i>Praise for Joseph Roth</i>: "The totality of Joseph Roth's work is no less than a <i>tragedie humaine</i> achieved in the techniques of modern fiction. No other writer, not excepting Thomas Mann, has come so close to achieving the wholeness...that Lukacs cites as our impossible aim." --Nadine Gordimer </p><p>"There is a poem on every page of Joseph Roth." --Joseph Brodsky </p><p>"Joseph Roth is one of the great writers in German of this century." --<i>The London Times</i> </p><p>"[Roth's] gifts...are substantial, and of a kind rarer now than it was fifty years ago." --<i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p>"Roth has the technique and style of a major writer.... His prose is always equal to the diverse effects he demands of it." --<i>The New Republic</i></p></p><h2>The Horror At Camp Jellyjam (Goosebumps - 33)</h2><p>Unable to fit in with the other kids at summer sports camp, Wendy, a non-athletic type, cannot understand what all the hype is over a little game of softball, but she is about to learn the origins of everyone&#39;s obsessive competitive streak.

Stripping away the comforting myths and illusions that we have grown up with since the Second World War, Mark Mazower presents an unflinching account of a continent locked in a finely balanced struggle between tolerance and racial extermination, imperial ambition and national self-determination, liberty and the tyrannies of Right and Left.</p><p>As the European Union introduces a common currency to world financial markets, Mark Mazower's <i>Dark Continent</i> critically examines the notion of "Europe." The Euro notwithstanding, Mazower argues that the "'Europe' of the European Union may be a promise or a delusion, but it is not a reality." Renouncing the notion of an essential "Europe," Mazower instead explores the conflicts which dominated the continent in the 20th century and the social value systems which informed them.<p> Mazower orders his examination chronologically, commencing with the collapse of Europe's continental empires following World War I and the initial European experiments in democracy and national self-determination which followed. He continues with analyses of state interventions in family health and the importance of healthy progeny, the financial crisis of the 1920s, the Hitler regime, the transformed democracy that emerged following World War II, the gradual erosion of the social state in the 1980s, and, finally, the collapse of communism. He consistently displays a firm grip of European history, directing his argument to readers with a foundational knowledge of the events that shaped 20th century Europe rather than historical novices unfamiliar with the period. Provocatively insightful, <i>Dark Continent</i> makes a convincing argument for a European 21st century characterized by continuity and harmony through divergence. "If Europeans can give up their desperate desire to find a single, workable definition of themselves," Mazower concludes, "they may come to terms more easily with the diversity and dissension which will be as much their future as their past." <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p>"Mazower's splendid book...makes a convincing case for a different version of 20th-century European history. 'We are quite wrong,' he writes, 'to read the present back into the past, and assume--for instance--that democracy must be rooted deep in Europe's soil.'"--Tony Judt , <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"If it's the business of historians to remember what others have forgotten, Mark Mazower <br>has done his job in Dark Continent."--Roane Carey, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>"Timely, argumentative, and ultimately optimistic; Mazower is particularly good at illuminating the substance of beliefs beneath ideologies."--<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"A masterful account of Europe's cursed century . . . Well written, with an excellent grasp of sources in several languages, this is a landmark study for the general reader." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>British reviews:<br>"Magnificent . . . an elegant plea for the defence of all that is best in the European tradition, and a reminder of what can happen if that trust is broken."--Alexandra Richie, <i>The Observer</i><br><br>"Brilliant but disturbing . . . if this superb book is a frightening reminder of how fragile democrary has been, we have lived through enough events in recent years to know how precious it is too."<br>--Orlando Figes, <i>The Times</i> <br><br>"Mark Mazower has already proved that he is a historian of great gifts . . . In Dark Continent he jumps from the microscopic to the telescopic with breath-taking self-confidence. His bold leap is entirely justified by his acheivement . . . He leaves us, in this wonderful book, with an account of our century that anyone who takes an interest in Europe's present and future will enlarge their minds by reading."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--John Keegan, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i><br><br>"[A] fascinating new polemic about twentieth-century Europe . . . this should be a deservedly popular book."--Mark Archer, <i>Financial Times</i><br><br>"Mark Mazower has provided a rich mixture in his highly individual and intelligent interpretation of Europe's twentieth-century history."--Richard Crampton, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"It is altogether remarkable that Mark Mazower, one of our brightest young historians, has managed to write about this subject [modern Europe] in such a way that you want to turn the pages . . . valuable and well-written."--Norman Stone, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"Exemplary...Written with verve and splendidly argued"--Richard Gott, <i>New Statesman</i></p><h2>When You Don&#39;t Know What To Say: Words of Caring for All Occasions 2nd Edition</h2><p>Since the first edition of this book was published in July 2007, it has become a popular resource for many.

These 500 exquisite examples, many by pioneering artisans, show just how much the bowl has been &#x201c;reinvented&#x201d; by craftpeople all over the world as both an iconic object and as a departure for self-expression. On display are a wide range of woodworking approaches, from chisel to chainsaw to router to bandsaw. Some have carvings on the suface; others feature paint and mixed media; while many more stay close to what nature provided, with the wood simply sanded and sealed. The talented creators include James Prestini, Bob Stocksdale, Rude Osolnik, Mel Lindquist, Ed Moulthrop, Mark Lindquist, David Ellsworth, and William Hunter.<br></p><p>"If you are looking for ideas for a project, an excellent source is Lark Books' 500 Series.

When the wife of one of Jonathan&#39;s opponents goes missing, among those the chief of police suspects are the third mayoral candidate (who is, unsurprisingly, an atheist), a prosperous fertility doctor and a local psychic who appears to have uncanny knowledge about the case. Despite some didactic moments (a biblical exposition of the dangers of divination, for example), the novel manages to be more plot-driven than message-driven, a step forward for evangelical Christian suspense. Numerous red herrings in the meticulously plotted story will keep readers guessing, and they will be delighted by the skillful surprise ending.

But when Jackson&#39;s wife turns up murdered, things begin to shift. Was this the act of a jealous lover? A dangerous client?

Judith McNaught lives in Houston. <p></p><b>Chapter One</b><br><br>"A toast to the duke of Claymore and his bride!"<br><br>Under normal circumstances, this call for a wedding toast would have caused the lavishly dressed ladies and gentlemen assembled in the great hall at Merrick castle to smile and cheer. Goblets of wine would have been raised and more toasts offered in celebration of a grand and noble wedding such as the one which was about to take place here in the south of Scotland.<br><br>But not today. Not at this wedding.<br><br>At this wedding, no one cheered and no one raised a goblet. At this wedding, everyone was watching everyone else, and everyone was tense. The bride's family was tense. The groom's family was tense. The guests and the servants and the hounds in the hall were tense. Even the first earl of Merrick, whose portrait hung above the fireplace, looked tense.<br><br>"A toast to the duke of Claymore and his bride," the groom's brother pronounced again, his voice like a thunderclap in the unnatural, tomblike silence of the crowded hall. "May they enjoy a long and fruitful life together."<br><br>Normally, that ancient toast brings about a predictable reaction: The groom always smiles proudly because he's convinced he's accomplished something quite wonderful. The bride smiles because she's been able to convince him of it. The guests smile because, amongst the nobility, a marriage connotes the linking of two important families and two large fortunes -- which in itself is cause for great celebration and abnormal gaiety.<br><br>But not today. Not on this fourteenth day of October, 1497.<br><br>Having made the toast, the groom's brother raised his goblet and smiled grimly at the groom. The groom's friends raised their goblets and smiled fixedly at the bride's family. The bride's family raised their goblets and smiled frigidly at each other. The groom, who alone seemed to be immune to the hostility in the hall, raised his goblet and smiled calmly at his bride, but the smile did not reach his eyes.<br><br>The bride did not bother to smile at anyone. She looked furious and mutinous.<br><br>In truth, Jennifer was so frantic she scarcely knew anyone was there. At the moment, every fiber of her being was concentrating on a last-minute, desperate appeal to God, Who out of lack of attention or lack of interest, had let her come to this sorry pass. <i>"Lord,"</i> she cried silently, swallowing, the lump of terror swelling in her throat, <i>"if You're going to do something to stop this marriage, You're going to have to do it quickly, or in five minutes 'twill be too late! Surely, I deserve something better than this forced marriage to a man who stole my virginity! I didn't just hand it over to him, You know!"</i><br><br>Realizing the folly of reprimanding the Almighty, she hastily switched to pleading: <i>"Haven't I always tried to serve You well,"</i> she whispered silently. <i>"Haven't I always obeyed You?"</i><br><br><i>"NOT ALWAYS, JENNIFER,"</i> God's voice thundered in her mind.<br><br>"Nearly <i>always,"</i> Jennifer amended frantically. <i>"I attended mass every day, except when I was ill, which was seldom, and I said my prayers every morning and every evening.</i> Nearly <i>every evening,"</i> she amended hastily before her conscience could contradict her again, <i>"except when I fell asleep before I was finished. And I</i> tried, <i>I truly</i> tried <i>to be all that the good sisters at the abbey wanted me to be. You know now hard I've tried! Lord,"</i> she finished desperately, <i>"if you'll just help me escape from this, I'll never be willful or impulsive again."</i><br><br><i>"THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE, JENNIFER,"</i> God boomed dubiously.<br><br><i>"Nay, I swear it,"</i> she earnestly replied, trying to strike a bargain. <i>"I'll do anything You want, I'll go straight back to the abbey and devote my life to prayer and -- "</i><br><br>"The marriage contracts have been duly signed. Bring in the priest," Lord Balfour commanded, and Jennifer's breath came in wild, panicked gasps, all thoughts of potential sacrifices fleeing from her mind. <i>"God,"</i> she silently pleaded, <i>"why are You doing this to me? You aren't going to let this happen to me, are You?"</i><br><br>Silence fell over the great hall as the doors were flung open.<br><br><i>"YES, JENNIFER, I AM."</i><br><br>The crowd parted automatically to admit the priest, and Jennifer felt as if her life were ending. Her groom stepped into position beside her, and Jennifer jerked an inch away, her stomach churning with resentment and humiliation at having to endure his nearness. If only she had <i>known</i> how one heedless act could end in disaster and disgrace. If only she hadn't been so impulsive and reckless!<br><br>Closing her eyes, Jennifer shut out the hostile faces of the English and the murderous faces of her Scots kinsmen, and in her heart she faced the wrenching truth: Impulsiveness and recklessness, her two greatest faults, had brought her to this dire end -- the same two character flaws that had led her to commit all of her most disastrous follies. Those two flaws, combined with a desperate yearning to make her father love her, as he loved his stepsons, were responsible for the debacle she'd made of her fife:<br><br>When she was fifteen, those were the things that had led her to try to avenge herself against her sly, spiteful stepbrother in what had seemed a right and honorable way -- which was to secretly don Merrick armor and then ride against him, fairly, in the lists. That magnificent folly had gained her a sound thrashing from her father right there on the field of honor -- and only a tiny bit of satisfaction from having knocked her wicked stepbrother clean off his horse!<br><br>The year before, those same traits had caused her to behave in such a way that old Lord Balder withdrew his request for her hand, and in doing so destroyed her father's cherished dream of joining the two families. And those things, in turn, were what got her banished to the abbey at Belkirk, where, seven weeks ago, she'd become easy prey for the Black Wolf's marauding army<br><br>And now, because of all that, she was forced to wed her enemy; a brutal English warrior whose armies had oppressed her country, a man who had captured her, held her prisoner, taken her virginity, and destroyed her reputation.<br><br>But it was too late for prayers and promises now. Her fate had been sealed from the moment, seven weeks ago, when she'd been dumped at the feet of the arrogant beast beside her, trussed up like a feastday partridge.<br><br>Jennifer swallowed. No, before that -- she'd veered down this path to disaster earlier that same day when she'd refused to heed the warnings that the Black Wolf's armies were nearby.<br><br>But why <i>should</i> she have believed it, Jennifer cried in her own defense. <i>"The Wolf is marching on us!"</i> had been a terrified call of doom issued almost weekly throughout the last five years. But on that day, seven weeks ago, it had been woefully true.<br><br>The crowd in the hall stirred restlessly, looking about for a sign of the priest, but Jennifer was lost in her memories of that day...<br><br>At the time, it had seemed an unusually pretty day, the sky a cheerful blue, the air balmy. The sun had been shining down upon the abbey, bathing its Gothic spires and graceful arches in bright golden light, beaming benignly upon the sleepy little village of Belkirk, which boasted the abbey, two shops, thirty-four cottages, and a communal stone well in the center of it, where villagers gathered on Sunday afternoons, as they were doing then. On a distant hill, a shepherd looked after his flock, while in a clearing not far from the well, Jennifer had been playing hoodman -- blind with the orphans whom the abbess had entrusted to her care.<br><br>And in that halcyon setting of laughter and relaxation, this travesty had begun. As if she could somehow change events by reliving them in her mind, Jennifer closed her eyes, and suddenly she was there again in the little clearing with the children, her head completely covered with the hoodman's hood....<br><br>"Where are you, Tom MacGivern?" she called out, groping about with outstretched arms, pretending she couldn't locate the giggling nine-year-old boy, who her ears told her was only a foot away on her right. Grinning beneath the concealing hood, she assumed the pose of a classic "monster" by holding her arms high in front of her, her fingers spread like claws, and began to stomp about, calling in a deep, ominous voice, "You can't escape me, Tom MacGivern."<br><br>"Ha!" he shouted from her right. "You'll no' find me, hoodman!"<br><br>"Yes, I will!" Jenny threatened, then deliberately turned to her left, which caused gales of laughter to erupt from the children who were hiding behind trees and crouching beside bushes.<br><br>"I've got you!" Jenny shouted triumphantly a few minutes later as she swooped down upon a fleeing, giggling child, catching a small wrist in her hand. Breathless and laughing, Jenny yanked off her hood to see whom she'd captured, mindless of the red gold hair tumbling down over her shoulders and arms.<br><br>"You got Mary!" the children crowed delightedly. "Mary's the hoodman now!"<br><br>The little five-year-old girl looked up at Jenny, her hazel eyes wide and apprehensive, her thin body shivering with fear. "Please," she whispered, clinging to Jenny's leg, "I -- I not want to wear th' hood -- 'Twill be dark inside it. Do I got to wear it?"<br><br>Smiling reassuringly, Jenny tenderly smoothed Mary's hair off her thin face. "Not if you don't want."<br><br>"I'm afeert of the dark," Mary confided unnecessarily, her narrow shoulders drooping with shame.<br><br>Sweeping her up into her arms, Jenny hugged her tightly. "Everybody is afraid of something," she said and teasingly added, "Why, I'm afraid of -- of <i>frogs!"</i><br><br>The dishonest admission made the little girl giggle. "Frogs!" she repeated, "I likes frogs! They don't sceer me 'tall."<br><br>"There, you see -- " Jenny said as she lowered her to the ground. "You're very brave. Braver than I!"<br><br>"Lady Jenny is afeart of silly ol' frogs," Mary told the group of children as they ran forward.<br><br>"No she isn -- " young Tom began, quick to rise to the defense of the beautiful Lady Jenny who, despite her lofty rank, was always up to anything -- including hitching up her skirts and wading in the pond to help him catch a fat bullfrog -- or climbing up a tree, quick as a cat, to rescue little Will who was afraid to come down.<br><br>Tom silenced at Jenny' s pleading look and argued no more about her alleged fear of frogs. "I'll wear the hood," he volunteered, gazing adoringly at the seventeen-year-old girl who wore the somber gown of a novice nun, but who was not one, and who, moreover, certainly didn't <i>act</i> like one. Why, last Sunday during the priest's long sermon, Lady Jenny's head had nodded forward, and only Tom's loud, false coughing in the bench behind her had awakened her in time for her to escape detection by the sharp-eyed abbess.<br><br>"'Tis Tom's turn to wear the hood," Jenny agreed promptly, handing Tom the hood. Smiling, she watched the children scamper off to their favorite hiding places, then she picked up the wimple and short woolen veil she'd taken off in order to be the hoodman. Intending to go over to the communal well where the villagers were eagerly questioning some clansmen passing through Belkirk on their way to their homes from the war against the English in Cornwall, she lifted the wimple, intending to put it on.<br><br>"Lady Jennifer!" One of the village men called suddenly, "Come quick -- there's news of the laird."<br><br>The veil and wimple forgotten in her hand, Jenny broke into a run, and the children, sensing the excitement, stopped their game and raced along at her heels.<br><br>"What news?" Jenny asked breathlessly, her gaze searching the stolid fares of the groups of clansmen. One of them stepped forward, respectfully removing his helm and cradling it in the crook of his arm. "Be you the daughter of the laird of Merrick?"<br><br>At the mention of the name Merrick, two of the men at the well suddenly stopped in the act of pulling up a bucket of water and exchanged startled, malevolent glances before they quickly ducked their heads again, keeping their faces in shadow. "Yes," Jenny said eagerly. "You have news of my father?"<br><br>"Aye, m'lady. He's comin' this way, not far behind us, wit a big band o' men."<br><br>Thank God," Jenny breathed. "How goes the battle at Cornwall?" she asked after a moment, ready now to forget her personal concerns and devote her worry to the battle the Scots were waging at Cornwall in support of King James and Edward V's claim to the English throne.<br><br>His face answered Jenny's question even before he said, "'Twas all but over when we left. In Cork and Taunton it looked like we might win, and the same was true in Cornwall, until the devil hisself came to take command 'o Henry's army."<br><br>"The devil?" Jenny repeated blankly.<br><br>Hatred contorted the man's face and he spat on the ground. "Aye, the devil -- the Black Wolf hisself, may he roast in hell from whence he was spawned."<br><br>Two of the peasant women crossed themselves as if to ward off evil at the mention of the Black Wolf, Scotland's most hated, and most feared, enemy, but the man's next words made them gape in fear: "The Wolf is comin' back to Scotland. Henry's sendin' him here with a fresh army to crush us for supportin' King Edward. 'Twill be murder and bloodshed like the last time he came, only worst, you mark me. The clans are making haste to come home and get ready for the battles. I'm thinkin' the Wolf will attack Merrick first, before any o' the rest of us, for 'twas your clan that took the most English lives at Cornwall."<br><br>So saying, he nodded politely, put on his helmet, then he swung up onto his horse.<br><br>The scraggly groups at the well departed soon afterward, heading down the road that led across the moors and wound upward into the hills.<br><br>Two of the men, however, did not continue beyond the bend in the road. Once out of sight of the villagers, they veered off to the right, sending their horses at a furtive gallop into the forest.<br><br>Had Jenny been watching, she might have caught a brief glimpse of them doubling back through the woods that ran beside the road right behind her. But at the time, she was occupied with the terrified pandemonium that had broken out among the citizens; of Belkirk, which happened to lie directly in the path between England and Merrick keep.<br><br>"The Wolf is coming!" one of the women cried, clutching her babe protectively to her breast. "God have pity on us."<br><br>"'Tis Merrick he'll strike at," a man shouted, his voice rising in fear. "'Tis the laird of Merrick he'll want in his jaws, but 'tis; Belkirk he'll devour on the way. "<br><br>Suddenly the air was filled with gruesome predictions of five and death and slaughter, and the children crowded around Jenny, clinging to her in mute horror. To the Scots, be they wealthy noble or lowly villager, the Black Wolf was more evil than the devil himself, and more dangerous, for the devil was a spirit, while the Wolf was flesh and blood -- the living Lord of Evil -- a monstrous being who threatened their existence, right here on earth. He was the malevolent specter that the Scots used to terrify their offspring into behaving. "The Wolf will get you," was the warning issued to keep children from straying into the woods or leaving their beds at night, or from disobeying their elders.<br><br>Impatient with such hysteria over what was, to her, more myth than man, Jenny raised her voice in order to be heard over the din. "'Tis more likely," she called, putting her arms around the terrified children who'd crowded against her at the first mention of the Wolf's name, "that he'll go back to his heathen ...</p><h2>Politically, Fashionably, and Aerodynamically Incorrect: The First Outland Collection</h2><p>A collection of the best strips from &#34;Outland,&#34; the Sunday spinoff of &#34;Bloom County,&#34; introduces Rosebud the Basselope and Milquetoast the cross-dressing cockroach</p><p></p><h2>The Great Mogul Diamond (The Dopple Ganger Chronicles)</h2><p>Everything was going so well for a change.

That&#x2019;s why I like the Herb Society of America&#x2019;s definition of an herb: &#x201c;a plant for use and delight.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s an impossibly broad definition, yes. But it&#x2019;s a definition that invites us to explore the widest possible uses of plants to provide taste, scent, medicine, fiber, dye, tools, artifacts, and symbols, from the distant beginnings of human culture to the present time.</p><p>Almost all societies have assigned symbolic meanings to plants. In China, for example, bamboo (which provides medicine, food, building materials, paper, and textiles) represents longevity, strength, and grace. In Hindu cultures, jasmine (used as a medicine, a flavoring, and a fragrance) symbolizes love, while once upon a time in the British Isles, green willow symbolized untrue or immature love.</p><p>Throughout human history, these symbolic meanings have been elaborated in art, poetry, and literature. During the early Victorian period, for instance, wealthy and leisured ladies and gentlemen frequently exchanged floral gifts in which a fanciful &#x201c;language of flowers&#x201d; was encoded. As Kathleen Gips puts it in her introduction to <i>Flora&#x2019;s Dictionary: The Victorian Language of Herbs and Flowers</i>, &#x201c;people expressed flowery thoughts by exchanging bouquets composed of carefully chosen plant words.&#x201d;</p><p>The definitions of these encoded &#x201c;plant words&#x201d; or floral symbols&#x2014;collectively, a <i>florigraphy</i>&#x2014;were published in Europe and America in an enduring and highly popular literary tradition made up of dozens of elaborate manuals that appeared in multiple editions. At their best, these were attractive, leather-bound volumes with gilt-edged pages and engraved illuminations, occasionally hand-colored. At the end of this book, you&#x2019;ll find some suggestions for further reading that will lead you deeper into the study of florigraphy and its many historical transformations. It&#x2019;s a subject that many garden and literary study groups might find interesting.</p><p>Of course, while herbs and plants are an important thematic and plot element in the books in the series (it&#x2019;s amazing how many mysteries there are in the lives of plants!), you&#x2019;re probably even more interested in the characters. China Bayles, of course, has always been front and center, with her herb shop, her lawyerly logic, and her tendency to be drawn into...well, murder. And, of course, Ruby Wilcox has never been far behind, playing the role of an intuitive Dr. Watson to China&#x2019;s logical Sherlock.</p><p>But now it&#x2019;s Ruby&#x2019;s turn to play Sherlock. <i>Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i> is her story&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s about time, don&#x2019;t you think? We&#x2019;ve already learned about her shop, her family (the daughter she gave up for adoption and who reappeared in <i>Hangman&#x2019;s Root</i>; the mom who has Alzheimer&#x2019;s), and her everyday life. We know about her bout with breast cancer (in <i>Mistletoe Man</i>) and her adventures with the Ouija board (<i>Rosemary Remembered</i> and <i>Bleeding Hearts</i>). In <i>Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i>, Ruby shows us just how good she is at looking deeply into mysteries that are hidden from everyone else&#x2014;even from China. To help while Ruby is doing this, Dawn Zudel of Columbia, Tennessee, (the winner of Story Circle&#x2019;s character raffle) has volunteered to tend her shop. Thanks, Dawn!</p><p><i>Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i> is also the story of the Great Galveston Hurricane, which forms the historical backdrop against which Ruby&#x2019;s story unfolds. The hurricane&#x2014;to this day, the deadliest natural disaster to hit the United States&#x2014;struck Galveston Island on September 8, 1900. It killed some eight to twelve thousand people (nobody really knows how many), wiped out whole families, and changed the destiny of the city of Galveston, which at the time rivaled Houston for the position of the most important city in Texas, indeed, on the entire Gulf Coast. I have created a fictional character, Rachel Blackwood, through whom to tell the story of the hurricane. But Rachel&#x2019;s story is based on the real stories of hurricane survivors recorded in many documents of the period. I&#x2019;ve listed my sources in the resource section at the end of this book.</p><p>An important reminder: throughout the China Bayles series, you will read many descriptions of the therapeutic uses of plants, both modern and historic. China and I fervently hope that you will seek informed, reliable advice before you decide to use any of these herbs to treat whatever ails you. Medicinal plants are &#x201c;natural,&#x201d; yes, but plant chemistry is not always well understood&#x2014;and the more we understand, the more cautious we are likely to be. Many herbs have potent side effects, especially when combined with over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Do your own careful homework and use all medicines, plant-based or otherwise, with mindful attention. China and I would not like to lose any of our readers&#x2014;especially <i>you</i>.</p><p>Susan Wittig Albert<br>Bertram, TX</p><p><i>Prologue</i></p><p><b><i>Galveston, Texas: The Oleander City<br>Saturday, September 8, 1900</i></b></p><p></p><p><b>The coast of Texas is according to the general laws of the motion of the atmosphere exempt from West India hurricanes and the two which have reached it followed an abnormal path which can only be attributed to causes known in meteorology as accidental....

Cline, Chief Meteorologist<br>Texas Section, U.S. Weather Bureau<br><i>Galveston Daily News</i>, July 16, 1891</b></p><p></p><p>Rachel Blackwood got up early that morning. She had not slept well: her youngest daughter, three-year-old Angela, was suffering from a sore throat and had cried often for her mother in the night, needing to be soothed.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t just Angela&#x2019;s whimpers that had disturbed her mother. It was the thunder of the waves on the beach that had kept her awake&#x2014;and the heat, the unspeakable, unbearable heat. According to the daily newspaper, the <i>Galveston</i> <i>News,</i> sultry weather had smothered almost the whole of the country that summer, from the Rockies east to Pennsylvania, from the Great Lakes south to the Gulf of Mexico. Thirty people in New York City had died one awful August Saturday. Dozens of others had succumbed in Chicago and Memphis, and at the St. Louis zoo, two bears and a leopard had been felled by the heat.</p><p>On Galveston Island, summers were usually cooled by ocean breezes, and the miles of shining white-sand beaches, groves of palm trees, and extravagant flower gardens made the city seem a paradise. But this year, summer in paradise had been marred by both sultry heat and unusual rains. During July and August, tropical storms had drenched the city&#x2014;sixteen inches of rain in one downpour, nine inches in another. Boys sailed the flooded downtown streets in wooden tubs, fish flopped across lawns, mothers despaired of ever getting the laundry dried in the damp air. And there were the morning fogs, and the foghorn in the lighthouse on the Bolivar Peninsula, a forlorn ghost calling, calling, calling through the dim gray mist.</p><p>The Blackwood household&#x2014;Rachel; her husband, Augustus (the newly appointed vice president of the Galveston National Bank); the five Blackwood children and their fifteen-year-old nurse, Patsy; and Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly, the family&#x2019;s longtime cook-housekeeper&#x2014;seemed to be moving in a languid and stuporous dream that summer, half-asleep under a sweltering blanket of humidity and heat. The thermometer on the back porch had registered 90 on Thursday and 91 on Friday, and when Rachel had taken the children the four blocks to the beach, they had complained that the Gulf was as warm as bathwater.</p><p>The morning air was cooler, though, and for the first time in weeks, Rachel could draw a deep breath as she slipped out of bed and dressed. But she had awakened to the strange, unsettled sense that something was different, something was...menacing. She went down to the kitchen to oversee Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s breakfast preparations and review the plans for Matthew&#x2019;s birthday supper that evening. Then out to the garden to pick an armful of dewy white roses and rosemary sprigs and the last few pink oleander blooms for the bowl on the table in the morning room. But all the while, she could not shake the feeling of apprehension. And even as she arranged the flowers in a crystal bowl, wondering once again why white roses were supposed to signify sadness when the rich scent of their silvery petals gave her so much pleasure, she was uneasy. Perhaps it was Angela&#x2019;s worrisome illness, or the rising north wind, unusual for September, that made a peculiar whistling in the eaves. Or the pounding of the surf that seemed much louder now than when she&#x2019;d gotten up, and the tremors of the wooden floor under her feet.</p><p>Rachel had occasionally felt the floor trembling during Gulf storms, although it had never been quite so pronounced as now. The Blackwood house was located on Q Avenue, just off Bath Avenue, only three blocks from the white-sand beach. The highest ground in the island city, on Broadway, rose only 8.7 feet above the Gulf, and some (perhaps remembering that Cabeza de Vaca had named the island <i>Malhado,</i> &#x201c;misfortune&#x201d;) had cautioned that a strong storm would flood the entire city. A seawall had been proposed as early as 1874 and several times since, but was considered to be too expensive and unnecessary. Isaac Cline, a noted meteorologist and chief of the Weather Bureau&#x2019;s Texas Section (and the Blackwoods&#x2019; neighbor on Q Avenue), had written in the <i>News</i> that it was &#x201c;simply an absurd delusion&#x201d; to believe that Galveston could be seriously damaged by a tropical storm. The city was protected by &#x201c;the general laws of the motion of the atmosphere.&#x201d;</p><p>Nevertheless, many prudent Galvestonians built their houses on pilings, and Rachel&#x2019;s husband, Augustus, was one of these. He had ordered his house to be constructed atop wooden piers driven deep into the island&#x2019;s sandy soil, ensuring that it would stand well above the highest of storm tides, locally called &#x201c;overflows.&#x201d; As he explained to Rachel, it was the piers, standing eight feet above the surface, which transmitted the shudder of the waves against the beach to the floors of the house. The trembling, he said with a confident smile, was in fact a token of the strength and security of its anchorage to the earth.</p><p>Indeed, it was not just a secure and solid house but a splendid house, as befitted a man of Mr. Blackwood&#x2019;s rank among Galveston&#x2019;s men of finance. It was a large, three-story towered and turreted Victorian, with a drawing room where Rachel served tea to the ladies who called every afternoon and a library filled with Augustus&#x2019; fine collection of books and a music room fitted out with a Steinway grand piano. There was a magnificent oak staircase, fireplaces with gleaming marble mantels, and glorious stained glass windows in the dining and drawing rooms, commissioned from the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company. The opulent furnishings and draperies, all in exquisite taste, had been brought from as far away as Paris and New York.</p><p>Painted a sober brown with red trim, this fine house was set back from the street behind a wrought iron fence, a border of oleanders and hollies, and a row of date palms, which in the late summer produced an abundance of fruit. The steps up to its wide front gallery were guarded by twin stone lions, each head turned to gaze thoughtfully at the other. The heavy bronze knocker on the oak front door wore the enigmatic face of Neptune, the god of the deep. And the steep slate roof was crowned with a wooden-railed widow&#x2019;s walk that offered a panoramic view of the island paradise and the vast blue-green Gulf stretching to the eastern horizon.</p><p>But while Mr. Blackwood prized his house for its solidity, its splendor, the beauty of its furnishings, and the view from its roof, Rachel prized it for far more. It was the home of her heart. It held all that was dear to her&#x2014;Augustus and her children: stalwart Matthew, ten years old this very day; sweet in-between Ida; the five-year-old mischievous twins, Peter and Paul; and dear baby Angela. To Rachel&#x2019;s great delight, the children were all very musical. Just the night before, they had all gathered in the music room. Matthew, a gifted young pianist, played the &#x201c;Maple Leaf Rag&#x201d; on the Steinway&#x2014;Scott Joplin&#x2019;s song was wildly popular everywhere. Then Rachel accompanied the children in one of the family&#x2019;s favorite songs, &#x201c;Sweet and Low,&#x201d; while Matthew played his flute, Ida played her harp, and Peter and Paul sang sweetly. Baby Angela, in her little red-painted rocking chair, laughed and clapped her hands. On the sofa, Augustus read his newspaper, smoking his favorite cherry tobacco. Rachel thought then that she had never been so happy. She could not know that she would never be happy again.</p><p>Since the house had been recently built, it made all sorts of interesting new-house noises, murmurs and sighs and groans as the pilings and joists and beams and rafters settled into place. All five of the children insisted that the house talked to them. Rachel often made an amusing little game of it with them, asking what the house was whispering today, what secrets it had to tell, what stories it wanted to hear. With giggles and great delight, they would tell her what the house had to say&#x2014;oh, such miraculous tales of intrigue and mystery! And then they would run to whisper their stories into the waiting ears of the stone lions that guarded the steps, for the lions were their dear friends and would keep them safe always, just as the house kept them safe.</p><p>At the morning breakfast table, Mr. Blackwood always read aloud items of interest from the <i>Galveston</i> <i>News</i>, believing that the children should know what kind of world they were going to inherit. The front page story concerned the Boxer Rebellion in China, where an eight-nation alliance was fielding an army of twenty thousand men to take Beijing and release the Americans and others held captive there. On page two, the latest census dominated the local news. Since 1890, Galveston&#x2019;s population had grown by nearly 30 percent, a rate much higher than rival port city Houston. (This news cheered Mr. Blackwood greatly, for he was a Galveston booster.) On page ten, Weather Bureau officials reported that they were monitoring a storm that appeared to be passing the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and while they felt it would probably go ashore somewhere in eastern Texas, they did not anticipate a &#x201c;dangerous disturbance.&#x201d; On the back page, the Galveston forecast was reassuringly routine: &#x201c;For eastern Texas: Rain Saturday, with high northerly winds; Sunday rain,...</p></p><h2>Cast On, Kill Off (Berkley Prime Crime)</h2><p><i>Wedding bells are ringing in Fort Connor, Colorado, and the House of Lambspun knitters are abuzz with excitement.

Alongside that event, there are many Darwin Day celebrations planned to acknowledge his 200th birthday. Add to these the virulent attacks of the New Atheists, led by Richard Dawkins. Bible-believing Christians will be left increasingly challenged with the theory of evolution as the only model to explain the origins and age of the universe.<br><br>In <i>More Than a Theory</i>, Hugh Ross, founder and president of Reasons To Believe, offers discerning readers a comprehensive, testable creation model to consider as an alternative. This fascinating resource will educate readers with a direct response to the recent and well-publicized challenges from aggressive atheists. In doing so, it also reminds the scientific community of what constitutes good science. Furthermore, it will supply Christians with the scientific information they need to defend their convictions that the God of the Bible is the Creator. <br><br>Complete with several appendices that put common documents and stories to the same test, <i>More Than a Theory</i> is a bold, brave, and unapologetic work of apologetics that will stir much discussion in both the scientific and religious realms.</p><p>"<i>More Than a Theory</i> provides a valuable overview of the many explanations of nature and human origins that compete for acceptance in modern culture. Rather than limiting this comparison to a single field such as biology, Hugh Ross compares these explanations with respect to their ability to adequately account for over 100 distinct findings from natural and social sciences. Ross effectively argues that by imposing artificial and unnecessary restraints on scientific inquiry, science loses its claim as a search for truth and simultaneously makes science less attractive to inquiring young minds. Removing those constraints unleashes the power of unbiased exploration in the quest for truth."--Carl A. Koval, professor of chemistry, University of Colorado<br><br>"The more we discover about the universe, the more I appreciate our Creator. And that's why I'm grateful for Hugh Ross.

Statutes and public opinion have shifted dramatically over recent decades in regard to these behaviors. The book details these developments and offers explanations of why they have occurred.<br><br>Some people view all or some of these behaviors as acts that ought to be permitted, as part of individual freedom. Others find one, some, or all of them to be genuine threats to the country's social and moral fiber and believe that they ought to be criminalized. Still others maintain that action ought to be taken to limit some of the behaviors, but that using the criminal justice system is not the best way to proceed.<br><br>Meier and Geis' provocative book offers sophisticated, in-depth discussions of these issues, then reviews the conflicting opinions about the proper role of criminal law in dealing with them. It is written in straightforward, jargon-free language, providing an ideal background for exploring the facts and views regarding what are often contentious concerns.<br><br><em>Criminal Justice and Moral Issues</em> increases student understanding through the abundant use of relevant illustrations, examples, and case studies.</p><p>Robert F.

Part I discusses, in quick overview, 131 categories of evidence from biology, astronomy, earth science, and the physical sciences. Part II describes the hydroplate theory, developed during 35 years of study and research by Walt Brown. This theory explains a catastrophic event in Earth&#39;s history and solves a host of recognized problems. Some chapters in Part II deal with: the origin of the Grand Canyon, evidence that shows comets, asteroids, and meteroids came from Earth. the sudden freezing and burial of the frozen mammoths, if there was a global flood, where the water came from and where it went, and how mountain ranges, volcanoes, submarine canyons, ocean trenches, and coal and oil deposits were formed. Thirty-seven other frequently asked questions fill a fascinating Part III of Brown&#39;s book. A few of those questions are: Is global warming occurring? If so, what causes it? Have scientific tools detected genetic traces of Adam and Eve within us? How accurate is radiocarbon dating? What about the dinosaurs? What hydroplate theory predictions have been confirmed? Is evolution compatible with the Bible?</p><p>Walt Brown received a PhD in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was a National Science Foundation Fellow. He has taught college courses in physics, mathematics, and computer science. Brown is a retired Air Force full colonel, West Point graduate, and former Army Ranger and paratrooper. Assignments during his 21 years of military service included: Director of Benet Laboratories (a major research, development, and engineering facility), tenured associate professor at the US Air Force Academy, and Chief of Science and Technology Studies at the Air War College. For much of his life Walt Brown was an evolutionist, but after years of study, he became convinced of the scientific validity of creation and a global flood. Since retiring from the military, Brown has been the Director of the Center for Scientific Creation and has worked full time in research, writing, and teaching on origins.

Their target was the temporary home of the Israeli Olympic team. Within 24 hours, 11 Israelis, five terrorists, and a German policeman were dead.<p> Based largely on exhaustive investigation for the Oscar-winning documentary, <i>One Day in September</i> is the definitive account of the tragedy. Simon Reeve has gathered extraordinary information from a number of sources, including recently released Stasi files and interviews with key figures, including the families of the hostages, politicians, policemen, advisors, fellow athletes, media figures, and even the lone surviving member of the group that carried out the attack. Reeve's control over his material is admirable. He vividly paints images of the individuals involved, humanizing a narrative that cracks and buzzes with the compact tension of those 24 hours. At the same time, he provides the background to the attack, filling in vital historical context from the distant and recent past, such as the Arab-Jewish dispute that produced this and other terrorist actions and their responses.</p><p> Reeve conveys the public horror of Jews being incarcerated on German soil, which led the German authorities to make crucial judgments, with tragic results. Fatal errors were made that can only be fully understood through the underlying dynamics of not only Middle East history, but also postwar European politics, individual and institutional arrogance, inexperience, and political pressure--including from the International Olympic Committee. Reeve follows up the events of that day by exposing the full extent of the Israeli revenge mission, which over the next 20 years hunted down and killed those responsible for the attack. He has not only written a compelling book, but provided a considerable service in allowing readers to understand the forces of hatred and history that conspired toward inevitable, but no less tragic human consequences.</p><p> Those who were a part of the huge live media audience that watched helplessly as events unfolded will undoubtedly experience again the sense of dread at recalling those traumatized, shackled figures led out from the Olympic Village to their fate on a German airfield. Those who make the mistake of thinking the dark days of international terrorism are history will read <i>One Day in September</i> and remember that the same underlying tensions still cast shadows over our present and our future. <i>--Fiona Buckland, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#34;In the early hours of 5 September 1972 the perimeter fence surrounding the Olympic Village in Munich was scaled by terrorists. Their target was the temporary home of the Israeli Olympic team, and within 24 hours seventeen men were dead: eleven Israelis, five terrorists and a German policeman. The attack by Black September, an ultra-violent faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was seen on television by more than 900 million viewers. The world watched as Jews suffered again on German soil. Yet despite the immediate attention given to the disaster crucial questions went unanswered. Why did so many die? And why have German officials covered up details of the massacre? Based largely on exhaustive investigations for the film One Day in September, this book is the definitive account of the massacre. With the help of previously secret documents, photographs and dozens of interviews, it reconstructs the tension of the day - and exposes the full extent of the Israeli &#39;Wrath of God&#39; revenge mission, which over the next twenty years saw Israeli agents systematically murder their way across Europe and the Middle East. One Day in September is the most compelling account yet written of events in Munich, of the devastating impact the attack had on the relatives of terrorists and athletes alike - and of the long shadow the massacre still casts over the modern world.&#34; One Day in September was published in 2000 by Faber and Faber in Britain, Arcade in the USA, and by Penguin in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. It has also been published and sold in a number of other countries around the world. The film One Day in September, narrated by the actor Michael Douglas, won the Oscar for Best Documentary.</p><h2>A Question of Death</h2><p>The Honourable Phryne Fisher--she of the Lulu bob, green eyes, Cupid&#39;s Bow lips, and diamante garters--is the 1920&#39;s most elegant and irrepressible sleuth. This sparkling collection of Phryne short stories and other Phryne miscellany--including Phryne&#39;s favourite shoes and hats, delicious cocktail recipes and her best tips for discouraging unwated admierers--is a gorgeously collectable treat for all Phryne fans. Lavishly illustrated with divine colour illustrations by Beth Norling, A Question of Death will bring joy to the hearts of Phryne Fisher fans everywhere.</p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written twenty novels, a number of plays, including The Troubadours with Stephen D&#39;Arcy, is an award-winning children&#39;s writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with Cocaine Blues which was a great success. Kerry has written sixteen books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003A QUESTION OF DEATH is an exquisite treasure for fans of Kerry Greenwood&#39;s mystery series, set in the 1920s and featuring detective Phryne Fisher. The deeply satisfying book is filled with such delectable details as an interview with Phryne, the author&#39;s description of Phryne&#39;s development into an intrepid Aussie sleuth, and short stories that fill in her early investigative experiences. However, dedicated Greenwood readers may prefer the print version, which features such visual delights by Beth Norling as &#34;What&#39;s in Phryne&#39;s Bag?,&#34; &#34;Phryne&#39;s Favorite Headpieces,&#34; fashions, favorite cocktail recipes, and an essential glossary. Stephanie Daniel perfectly captures Phryne&#39;s upper-crust, refined British articulation, as well as the accents of characters from distant lands. Daniel bravely tackles the diversity of the volume&#39;s many gems.

But in an air nostalgically sweet with caramel apple and spun sugar, one crooked game ends with a brutal death ... and Judge Deborah Knott will discover more than a body. For beneath the carnival&#39;s razzle-dazzle surface swirl dark secrets that Deborah has kept hidden for almost twenty years. Now as family loyalties war with the demands of the law, she must struggle to win a carny&#39;s trust-before the killer pins a bull&#39;s-eye on yet another victim.</p><p>You can almost smell the cotton candy and hear the barkers inviting you to try your skill at a game of chance in this lively new mystery starring Colleton County, North Carolina, Judge Deborah Knott. Knott's stunned to discover that Brazos Hartley, murdered on the midway at the Harvest Festival carnival, was a member of her family; his mother, Tally Ames, is Deborah's first cousin, born of a shotgun marriage and abandoned as a child by her father, Deborah's brother. Naturally, when there's a second carnival murder, Deborah can't help getting involved in the investigation, even if it means uncovering secrets some of her relatives would just as soon keep confidential. The huge Knott clan, with Deborah at its center, gives Maron a wealth of material (the judge herself is one of 12 siblings!), which she makes the most of with wonderfully drawn characters and a beautifully evoked setting. The next best thing to a summer night at a country carnival, <i>Slow Dollar</i> is a standout in a series that just keeps getting better. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>MARGARET MARON</b> grew up in the country near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she and her artist husband returned to the farm that had been in her family for a hundred years, she began a series based on her own background.

In his account of a year spent studying a flock of wild turkeys in the loblolly pine woods of Florida, he aims to improve their reputation. They are, he notes, masters of disguise, blending in with their surroundings in ways so subtle as to make the work of predators--especially human hunters--difficult. And, he writes, they are &#34;curious to a fault, want a working understanding of every aspect of their surroundings, and their memory is impeccable.&#34; His affectionate portrait may not convince English speakers to stop calling each other turkeys, but it will make welcome reading for birders and wildfowl enthusiasts.When Joe Hutto began his experiment in imprinting two dozen wild turkey&#x2014;in the tradition of the great animal behaviorist, Konrad Lorenz&#x2014;he had no idea that it would change his life. Told with skill and humor, and vibrating with the natural wonders of the Florida flatwoods, Illumination in the Flatwoods will amaze and enrich all who share this season with the wild turkey.<br><br></p><h2>The Facts of Life and Other Dirty Jokes</h2><p>If you had to give America a voice, it&#x2019;s been said more than once, that voice would be Willie Nelson&#x2019;s. For more than fifty years, he&#x2019;s taken the stuff of his life-the good and the bad-and made from it a body of work that has become a permanent part of our musical heritage and kept us company through the good and the bad of our own lives. Long before he became famous as a performer, Willie Nelson was known as a songwriter, keeping his young family afloat by writing songs-like &#x201c;Crazy&#x201d;-that other people turned into hits.<br><br>So it&#x2019;s fitting, and cause for celebration, that he has finally set down in his own words, a book that does justice to his great gifts as a storyteller. In<b> The Facts of Life</b>, Willie Nelson reflects on what has mattered to him in life and what hasn&#x2019;t. He also tells some great dirty jokes. The result is a book as wise and hilarious as its author. It&#x2019;s not meant to be taken seriously as an instruction manual for living-but you could do a lot worse.</p><p>&#x201c;Who knew the world&#x2019;s best-loved country singer had such a good sense of humor?&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Texas Monthly<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t not like Willie Nelson.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The San Diego Union-Tribune<br><br>&#x201c;Pure Willie Nelson...equal parts minstrel, scoundrel, and cowboy&#x2014;and all of it&#x2019;s genuine.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Washington Times<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Born in Abbott, Texas, on April 29, 1933, Willie Nelson is one of the most popular, prolific, and influential songwriters and singers in the history of American music.

Kahaner ( On the Line ) draws distinctions between satanism and witchcraft and shows how such Latin American phenomena as Santeria (perverted worship of the saints) and Brujeria (a mix of ancient Aztec practices and Catholicism) are allied. But, most disturbing, apart from the reports of children involved in ritual practices, are the testimonies of adults who joined in such incidents in their youth and have been scarred by their involuntary participation. This is a revealing study that will prove shocking to readers.

It is the story of the Northern Ireland troubles told as never before, it is not concerned with the political bickering but with the lives of those who have suffered and the deaths which have resulted from more than three decades of conflict. This volume is filled with passion and violence, with humanity and inhumanity. It is the story of the Northern Ireland troubles; it is not concerned with political bickering but with the lives of those who have suffered and the deaths which have resulted from more than three decades of conflict. The authors - three of them Belfast-born and the fourth an American - are journalists. Over a seven-year period they examined every death which was directly caused by the troubles. Their research involved interviewing witnesses, scouring published material and drawing on a range of investigative sources to produce this study. The book traces the origins of the conflict from the firing of the first shots, through the carnage of the 1970s and 1980s and up to the republican and loyalist ceasefires and beyond. All the casualties are here: the RUC officer, the young soldier, the IRA volunteer, the loyalist paramilitary, the Catholic mother, the Protestant worker, the new-born baby.</p><p>David McKittrick has been the Ireland correspondent of The Independent since 1986 and was named correspondent of the year in 1999 by BBC2&#39;s What the Papers Say. He has won a number of other awards during more than 20 years of reporting on Northern Ireland, among them the Christopher Ewart-Biggs memorial prize for the promotion of peace and understanding in Ireland. His publications include four collections of his journalism. Seamus Kelters is an assistant news editor with the BBC in Belfast. He has also worked as a producer with BBC Northern Ireland&#39;s political unit and its current affairs programme Spotlight. Before joining the BBC he was a senior reporter with the Irish News where he specialised in security-related stories. He has written a book on Gaelic games. Brian Feeney, who holds a doctorate in Irish history, lives in Belfast and is a senior lecturer at a teacher-training college there. An experienced political commentator, he writes a weekly column for a local newspaper and was formerly a city councillor for almost a decade. Widely travelled, he is regarded as an expert on electoral mechanisms. Chris Thornton, an American living in Belfast, is the security correspondent of the Belfast Telegraph. He has previous experience with both of Belfast&#39;s main morning newspapers, the News Letter and the Irish News.McKittrick (Through the Minefield, LJ 2/15/00) and his coauthors are all experienced journalists of the North Ireland beat. This book is a 1600-page obituary, cataloging each life lost during "the Troubles," a huge undertaking whose results have garnered accolades in the U.K. and Ireland. The 3,638 deaths from 1966 to 2000 are chronologically numbered and indexed. Each entry includes the name, number, date of death, county of habitation, marital status, age, religion, occupation, and where appropriate affiliation (IRA, UVF, UDF, British Army, etc.). Assembled from official casualty lists, newspaper accounts, secondary sources, conversations, privately published pamphlets, and the authors' own notes, entries range from a few lines to virtual chapters. West Belfast is the deadliest neighborhood, and the IRA is responsible for almost half the deaths, though a sizable minority of the victims dies from their own blunders, e.g., premature bomb detonation. Like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, this book tallies the human cost of "the Troubles" in one place. To say that the book is sad or numbing would be an understatement. It belongs in every public and academic library.<br><i>Robert C.

Original.</p><p><p>Alison Gaylin, a journalist who has covered arts and entertainment for the past ten years, is the author of&nbsp;<i>Hide Your Eyes</i>, an Edgar� Award finalist for Best First Novel,&nbsp;<i>You Kill Me</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Trashed</i>.</p>In journalist Gaylin's sharp debut suspense novel, preschool teacher and off-off-Broadway box office staffer Samantha Leiffer is happy with her offbeat life in downtown Manhattan--"the kind of muted happy that you don't notice at the time." Then, sitting on an abandoned pier taking a break from a tough day, she witnesses a couple disposing of an ice chest in the Hudson's chilly waters. Sam realizes that the man has seen her watching--and when the chest turns out to hold the body of a mutilated child, she's drawn into a world of intrigue. Attacks on Sam as well as key friends force her to try to unravel clues to the murder. Her chief ally is policeman John Krull, whose quiet solidity leads her gradually toward love. Though the crime plot overshadows several of Gaylin's most appealing secondary situations late in the book, this is a consistently entertaining evocation of Manhattan's strange and artsy underside, narrated by a heroine with a beautifully judged blend of warmth and wit, independence and edge. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her company, Autism Making a Difference, Inc., provides workshops and training materials.</p><b>Dispelling the Myths of ASD</b><p> <b>Myth #1: The Rain Man Myth</b></p><p> There are certainly individuals with ASDs who have extraordinary talent or, more usually, an inconsistent profile where they excel or do well in one area and have low performance in others. For example, years ago I worked with a young man who had a gift for memorizing and was infatuated with sports. On my first day of work at Fairview State Hospital, he came up to me and said, "I used to be a sports newscaster. Ask me any question about sports and I'll fill you in." He had memorized the pertinent statistics for all the World Series from the previous two decades. We talked sports and I did find him a bit odd. For a few minutes I entertained the thought that he was another employee, thinking what a dedicated person he must be to quit working for the media and join the staff at this hospital. Then I looked on my roster and realized he was one of my students for functional living skills. He definitely had a talent for sports statistics, but hadn't yet learned how to dress himself independently or tie his own shoes.</p><p> However, there are many more individuals with ASDs who have no particular special talent, any more than the rest of us do.</p><p> <b>Myth #2:</b></p><p> Everyone who has an ASD is a genius, a Thomas Jefferson in waiting. It is true that some people with ASDs are geniuses, but not everyone is. Thomas Jefferson, it appears, had characteristics of Asberger's, within the range of modern diagnostic criteria. Others such as Beethoven, Isaac Newton, and Einstein have all been mentioned as famous people who could have been diagnosed as on the spectrum. However, for every person with ASD who is a genius, there are many more who are mere mortals like ourselves.</p><p> <b>Myth #3:</b></p><p> Everyone who has an ASD is mentally retarded.</p><p> If you start with the perception that someone is mentally retarded, the expectations for that individual aren't going to be very high, and he will never be given the opportunity to reach as far as he can go. Better to hope he's a genius and be disappointed than never to have given a person the benefit of the doubt. The reality is that the population of people with ASDs is much like the general population: some of us have special talents, some of us are geniuses, and some of us are retarded. But most of us are just average earthlings.</p><p> <b>Myth #4:</b></p><p> Everyone who has a symptom of an ASD has an ASD. If a person has one or two characteristics of an ASD, it does not necessarily mean he has an ASD. It is the number and severity of behavioral characteristics in the areas of social interaction, communication, and repetitive stereotypical behaviors that causes concern. That is why it's important to consult with a medical professional who is familiar with ASDs.</p><p> Myth #5: There is no cure for (or recovery from) ASDs</p><p> There is no magical pill that cures everyone. However, there are cases of children who were diagnosed as clearly having ASDs, and who are now considered to be neurotypical or symptom-free by professionals thanks to interventions they have received. Recovery means that they have to have overcome some of the symptoms they had that made it difficult for them to live full and successful lives in a world created by neurotypicals. <b>Myth #6:</b></p><p> People with ASDs have no emotions and do not get attached to other people</p><p> It is true that people with an ASD show emotions in a different way from neurotypicals. However, just because a person does not show emotions in the way we are used to seeing them exhibited does not mean that they don't have feelings. One only has to read accounts by people with autism to realize that some individuals express emotions differently or are unable to show emotion at all because they are not in control of their muscles or motor planning.</p></p><h2>Judy&#39;s Journey</h2><p>Judy lives in a tent with her family.

With a pitch-perfect comic voice and an eye for social satire to rival Swift or Wolfe, bestselling author William Kotzwinkle limns Hal's hilarious journey to New York, Los Angeles, and the great sprawling country in between, where a bear makes good despite his animal instincts, and where money-hungry executives see not a hairy beast with a purloined novel, but a rough-hewn, soulful, media-perfect nature guy who just might be the next Hemingway.<br><br> By turns sidesplittingly funny, stingingly ironic, and unexpectedly tender, <i>The Bear Went Over the Mountain</i> captures the zeitgeist of the 1990s dead-on, in a delicious bedtime story for grown-ups.</p><p>You might think that a writer best-known for novelizing the movie &#34;E.T.&#34; would find a satire on the book publishing industry hitting a bit close to home, but William Kotzwinkle seems quite comfortable with the task in this comic fable. In Kotzwinkle&#39;s merry send-up, the author of the hit novel &#34;Desire and Destiny&#34; is a bear, a real bear, who after finding the manuscript under a spruce tree and attaching his nom de plume, Hal Jam, becomes rich and famous overnight. Obtuse editors, star-hound agents, and a right-wing televangelist and Presidential candidate all warm to Hal&#39;s warm, bearish honesty without bothering to read his book--or to notice that he&#39;s an animal, for that matter. It&#39;s an old gag turned by a canny author to amusing, if not always compelling, purposes.<p><b>William Kotzwinkle</b> is a two-time winner of the National Magazine Award for Fiction, a winner of the World Fantasy Award, and a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p></p><h2>Over the River and Through the Wood (Blue Ribbon Book)</h2><p>Full color illustrations accompany the verses of the traditional Thanksgiving Day song</p><p>Lydia Marie Child (1802-1880) was a celebrated American author, abolitionist, and women&#39;s rights activist. Born in Medford, MA, her grandfather&#39;s house still stands near the Mystic River as a tangible reminder of her most memorable poem.PreS - Grade 2-- This attractive new presentation of Child's 1844 poem,"A Boy's Thanksgiving Day," offers 13 full-page watercolors done in a detailed and delicately primitive style. As befits this style, the figures are somewhat stiff, and the overall effect is static. The colors are pleasingly light and clear. The childlike illustrations are in keeping with the unsophisticated nature of the rhyming text. Unlike the version illustrated with lively energy by Brinton Turkle (Coward, 1974), only 6 of the 12 verses are included, a streamlining that modern preschool and primary-grade teachers may well appreciate. The text is placed unobtrusively in the sky or on the snow-covered ground, and probably sings better than it reads. A piano arrangement of the familiar melody, a traditional French folk tune, is placed after the text. Child's time-honored poem successfully evokes the happy mood of a traditional and idealized family holiday gathering. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Healing Dreams: Exploring the Dreams that can Transform you Life</h2><p>A new guide to interpreting dreams takes readers a step further in their exploration of the unconscious, explaining how to apply the important lessons of dreams to everyday life.

But when the Clone Wars erupted, bringing severe rationing of imported resources and a Republic ban on the production of battle droids, Ord Cestus was threatened with imminent economic collapse.<br><br>Enter the Confederacy of Independent Systems&#x2014;the Separatists&#x2014;with a life-saving offer to purchase a generous quantity of the planet&#x2019;s most lucrative export: bio-droids. Possessed of tactical capabilities that rival the fighting abilities of even the most advanced Jedi, these sophisticated, techno-organic hybrid units would prove a most formidable weapon if ever deployed for military use. And now the Confederacy&#x2019;s intention to invest in what amounts to an army of bio-droids has sent ripples of alarm through the highest echelons of the Republic government.<br><br>Determined to halt the bio-droid sale&#x2014;but fearing a show of force will result in a political backlash&#x2014;Supreme Chancellor Palpatine dispatches a team of envoys, led by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Diplomacy is paramount. But if all else fails, the Republic will not hesitate to launch a full-scale attack&#x2014;and wipe out not only the means of bio-droid production, but countless lives as well, to demonstrate the consequences of disloyalty.<br><br>For Obi-Wan, the prospect of such wholesale slaughter only serves to fuel his growing suspicions about the sinister path the Republic seems to be taking. But the brash Jedi Master Kit Fisto and the detachment of clone soldiers assigned to the mission are ready and willing to do the Supreme Chancellor&#x2019;s bidding. As the leaders of Ord Cestus refuse to capitulate and Palpatine rapidly loses patience, Obi-Wan&#x2019;s hopes of a peaceful resolution are dwindling. Now, facing a crisis of conscience, Obi-Wan must find the wisdom and strength to prevent a bloodbath and safeguard the Republic&#x2014; while abiding by the ancient code to which he has pledged his life.</p><p><b>Steven Barnes</b> is a prolific author and script writer who has been nominated for Hugo, Cable Ace, and Endeavor awards.

Its bridges and arched solaria harked back to ages past, when no leader&#x2019;s words seemed too grand, no skyscraper too spectacular, and titanic civic sprawls boldly proclaimed the rational mind&#x2019;s conquest of the cosmos.<br><br>With the coming of the Clone Wars, some believed such glorious days were past. Whether the news holos spoke of victory or defeat, it was all too easy to imagine flaming ships spiraling to their doom beneath distant skies, the clash of vast armies, the death of uncounted and uncountable dreams. It was almost impossible not to wonder if one day war&#x2019;s ravening maw might not envelop this, the Republic&#x2019;s jeweled locus. This was a time when the word city symbolized not achievement, but vulnerability. Not haven, but havoc.<br><br>But despite those fears, Coruscant&#x2019;s billions of citizens kept faith and continued about their myriad lives. A flock of hook-beaked thrantcills flew in perfect diamond formation through Coruscant&#x2019;s placid, pale blue sky. For a hundred thousand standard years they had winged south for the winter, and might for yet another. Their flat black eyes had watched civilization force Coruscant&#x2019;s animal life into inexorable retreat. The planet&#x2019;s former masters now scavenged in her duracrete canyons, their natural habitats replaced with artificial marshes and permacrete forests. This, others argued, was a time of marvels and marvelous beings from a hundred thousand different worlds. This was a time for optimism, for dreams, and for unbridled ambition.<br><br>A time of opportunity, for those with vision to see.<br>The red-and-white disk of a two-passenger Limulus-class transport sliced through Coruscant&#x2019;s cloud-mantle. In the morning sun it glittered like a sliver of silvered ice. Spiral-dancing to inaudible music, it had detached its hyperdrive ring in orbit, slipping through wispy clouds to land with a shush as gentle as a kiss. Its smooth, glassy side rippled. A rectangular outline appeared and then slid up. A tall, bearded man wrapped in a brown robe stepped into the doorway and hopped down, followed by a second, clean-shaven passenger.<br><br>The bearded man&#x2019;s name was Obi-Wan Kenobi. For more years than he cared to count, Obi-Wan had been one of the most renowned Jedi Knights in the entire Republic. The second, a startlingly intense younger man with fine brown hair, was named Anakin Skywalker. Although not yet a full Jedi Knight, he was already famed as one of the galaxy&#x2019;s most powerful warriors.<br><br>For thirty-six hours the two had juggled flying and navigational duties, using their Jedi skills to hold their needs for sleep and sustenance to a minimum. Obi-Wan was tired, irritable, famished, and felt as if someone had poured sand into his joints. Anakin, he noticed, seemed fresh and ready for action.<br><br>The recuperative powers of youth, Obi-Wan thought ruefully.<br><br>Only an emergency directive from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine himself could have summoned the two from their assignment on Forscan VI.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Master,&#x201d; Anakin said. &#x201c;I suppose this is where we part company.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not certain what this is about,&#x201d; the older man replied, &#x201c;but your time will be well spent studying at the Temple.&#x201d;<br><br>Obi-Wan and Anakin continued down the skywalk. Far beneath them the city streets buzzed with traffic, the walkways and ground-level construction occasionally interrupted by wisps of cloud or stray thrantcills. The web of streets and bridges behind and below them was dazzling, but Obi-Wan noticed the beauty little more than he had the height, the fatigue, or the hunger. At the moment, his mind was occupied by other, more urgent concerns.<br><br>As if his Padawan could read his thoughts, Anakin spoke. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re not still annoyed with me, Master.&#x201d;<br><br>There it was, another reference to Anakin&#x2019;s rash actions on Forscan VI. Forscan VI was a colony planet at the edge of the Cron drift, currently unaffiliated with either Republic or Confederacy. Elite Separatist infiltration agents had set up a training camp on Forscan, their &#x201c;exercises&#x201d; playing havoc with the settlers. The most delicate aspect of the counteroperation was repelling those agents without ever letting the colonists know that outsiders had assisted them. Tricky. Dangerous.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Obi-Wan said. &#x201c;We contained the situation. My approach is more . . . measured. But you displayed your usual initiative. You weren&#x2019;t disobeying a direct order, so . . . we&#x2019;ll mark it down to creative problem solving, and leave it at that.&#x201d;<br><br>Anakin breathed a sigh of relief. Powerful bonds of love and mutual respect connected the two men, but in times past Anakin&#x2019;s impulsiveness had tested those bonds sorely. Still, there was little doubt that the Padawan would receive Obi-Wan&#x2019;s highest recommendations. Years of observation had forced Obi-Wan to grant that Anakin&#x2019;s seeming impetuosity was in fact a deep and profound understanding of superior skills.<br><br>&#x201c;You were right,&#x201d; Anakin said, as if Obi-Wan&#x2019;s mild answer gave him permission to admit his own errors. &#x201c;Those mountains were impassable. Confederacy reinforcements would have bogged down in the ice storm, but I couldn&#x2019;t take the chance. There were too many lives at stake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It takes maturity to admit an error,&#x201d; Obi-Wan said. &#x201c;I think we can keep these thoughts between us. My report will reflect admiration for your initiative.&#x201d;<br><br>The two comrades faced, and gripped each other&#x2019;s forearms. Obi-Wan had no children, and likely never would. But the unity of Padawan and Master was as deep as any parent&#x2013;child bond, and in some ways deeper still. &#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; Anakin said. &#x201c;Give my regards to Chancellor Palpatine.&#x201d;<br><br>A hovercar slid in next to the walkway, and Anakin hopped aboard, disappearing into the sky traffic without a backward glance.<br><br>Obi-Wan shook his head. The boy would be fine. Had to be fine. If a Jedi as gifted as Anakin could not rise above youthful hubris, what hope was there for the rest of them?<br><br>But meanwhile there was a more immediate matter to consider. Why exactly had he been called back to Coruscant? Certainly it must be an emergency, but what kind of emergency . . . ?<br>The appointed meeting place was the T&#x2019;Chuk sporting arena, a tiered shell with seating for half a million thronging spectators. Here chin-bret, Coruscant&#x2019;s most popular spectator sport, was played before hundreds of thousands of cheering fans. Today, however, no expert chin-bretier leapt in graceful arcs across the sand; no pikers vaulted about returning serves. No cerulean-vested goalkeepers veered like mad demicots, hoisting their team&#x2019;s torch aloft. Today the vast stadium was empty, cleared and sequestered, hosting a very different sort of gathering.<br><br>As he emerged from the echoing length of pedestrian tunnel, Obi-Wan scanned the tiered stands. Most of the rows were as empty as a Tatooine desertscape, but a few dozen witnesses were gathered in the box-seat section. He recognized a scattering of high-level elected officials, some important but ordinarily reclusive bureaucrats, a few people from the technical branches, and even some clone troopers. Instinct and experience suggested that this was a war council.<br><br>Over time the Clone Wars&#x2019; initial chaos had settled into a tidal rhythm; loyalties declared, alliances formed. The galaxy was too vast for war to touch all its myriad shores, but at any given time battles raged on a hundred different worlds. While that number represented an insignificant fraction of the billions of star systems swirling about the galaxy, due to long-standing alliances and partnerships, what happened to millions of living beings had the potential to affect trillions.<br><br>Already kingdoms, nations, and families had been ravaged by the wars. As the numbers grew and weapons inevitably became more and more powerful, devastation might well spiral out of control, offsetting the countless eons of struggle that had finally birthed a galaxywide union. The labor of a thousand generations, vanished?<br><br>Never!<br><br>Lines had been drawn: Separatists on the one side, and the Republic on the other. For Obi-Wan as well as many others, that line was drawn with his own life&#x2019;s blood. The Republic would stand, or Obi-Wan and every Jedi who had ever strode the Temple&#x2019;s halls would fall. It was a simple equation.<br><br>And in simplicity there was both clarity and strength.</p><h2>The Guardians: An Elegy for a Friend</h2><p><p><i>The Guardians</i> opens with a story from the July 24, 2008, edition of the <i>Riverdale Press</i> that begins, &#x201c;An unidentified white man was struck and instantly killed by a Metro-North train last night as it pulled into the station on West 254th Street.&#x201d; Sarah Manguso writes: &#x201c;The train&#x2019;s engineer told the police that the man was alone and that he jumped. The police officers pulled the body from the track and found no identification. The train&#x2019;s 425 passengers were transferred to another train and delayed about twenty minutes.&#x201d;</p><p><i>The Guardians</i> is an elegy for Manguso&#x2019;s friend Harris, two years after he escaped from a psychiatric hospital and jumped under that train. The narrative contemplates with unrelenting clarity their crowded postcollege apartment, Manguso&#x2019;s fellowship year in Rome, Harris&#x2019;s death and the year that followed&#x2014;the year of mourning and the year of Manguso&#x2019;s marriage. As Harris is revealed both to the reader and to the narrator, the book becomes a monument to their intimacy and inability to express their love to each other properly, and to the reverberating effects of Harris&#x2019;s presence in and absence from Manguso&#x2019;s life. There is grief in the book but also humor, as Manguso marvels at the unexpected details that constitute a friendship. <i>The Guardians</i> explores the insufficiency of explanation and the necessity of the imagination in making sense of anything.</p></p><p><p>Sarah Manguso is the author of a memoir, <i>The Two Kinds of Decay</i>; two books of poetry, <i>Siste Viator</i> and <i>The Captain Lands in Paradise</i>; and a short-story collection, <i>Hard to Admit and Harder to Escape</i>.</p><br>&nbsp;<br>The Thursday edition of the <i>Riverdale Press</i> carried a story that began <i>An unidentified white man was struck and instantly killed by a Metro-North train last night as it pulled into the Riverdale station on West 254th Street.</i><br>The train&#x2019;s engineer told the police that the man was alone and that he jumped.

The train&#x2019;s 425 passengers were transferred to another train and delayed about twenty minutes.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>If I were a journalist I&#x2019;d have spoken to everyone and written everything down right away. I&#x2019;d have gone to the hospital and met all the people who were on the psychiatric ward at the moment Harris walked out the door, and then this book would be a more accurate rendering of the truth.<br>If I were to write responsibly, with adequate research to confirm certain facts, I&#x2019;d have to ask people about the last time they saw or spoke with or heard from my friend Harris. I&#x2019;m afraid to ask his parents those questions. I&#x2019;m afraid to talk with his last lover. I&#x2019;m afraid to meet his doctors and the man who drove the train.<br>For three years I&#x2019;ve studied klezmer orchestration, the physics of rainstorms, maps of Eastern Europe. I thought I could trade my life for this useless, vigorous research. Since I was afraid to know so many answers, I didn&#x2019;t ask any questions, and now it&#x2019;s been three years. Now no one could possibly be able to remember the mundanities of July 23, 2008.<br>I could have waited until the end of my life to try to understand what happened on that day, saved it for last so I could know its whole effect, but instead I waited what seems an arbitrary, meaningless length of time.<br>I tried so hard not to notice Harris&#x2019;s death, I barely remember it. Time eroded the memory of it even as it gathered the dust of what&#x2019;s happened since. But I need to try to remember it now so I might keep it from haunting me.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>We know the lost time begins just after noon because that&#x2019;s what the desk nurse said, and we know it ends at 10:48 because that&#x2019;s when the train pulled into the station. Sometime during that minute, maybe the engineer engaged the air brake. Maybe he blew the whistle. And before or after the engineer did those things, the train&#x2019;s snub nose, or maybe its whole underside, just above the rails, made contact with my friend&#x2019;s still living body.<br>I want to say that ten hours are missing from Harris&#x2019;s life, but that isn&#x2019;t right. They were in his life. They just weren&#x2019;t in anyone else&#x2019;s.<br>Though I wish I could, I can&#x2019;t say Harris lay down on the train track and felt relief. I can&#x2019;t imagine anything but torment, a blinding light, then nothing.<br>What I carry now&#x2014;it brightens sometimes, without warning&#x2014;is not his pain. This pain is mine, and unlike my friend, I don&#x2019;t try to hide it. I let it get all over everything. I yell in my studio. I cry on the subway. I tell everyone I know that my friend threw himself under a train.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Some people believe that only the selfish accept suicide as a possibility, but I don&#x2019;t believe suicide is available to everyone. It was available to me for a moment, and then a door shut between me and it. The door has stayed shut.<br>Some people think I should be angry at Harris, but I&#x2019;m not angry. I believe in the possibility of unendurable suffering.<br>A man whose lover died slowly wants this book to be about love.<br>A man whose brother died quickly wants this book to be about rage. <i>I couldn&#x2019;t save my brother</i>, he says. <i>It never goes away</i>, he says.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Sometimes I wish someone else had died instead&#x2014;someone who blocks the open subway doors, for example, or someone who leaves piles of peanut shells on a train car.

And I&#x2019;d have traded the man who unwrapped a candy, placed it in his mouth, dropped the wrapper on the platform in front of his feet, chewed, unwrapped another candy, placed it in his mouth, dropped the wrapper on the platform in front of his feet, chewed.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Harris played music, wrote software, wrote music, learned to drive, went to college, went to bed with girls, moved to New York, moved to California, went to graduate school, moved back to New York, went to more graduate school. His three psychotic breaks occupied almost no part of his actual life.<br>During the first episode, he hired a lawyer, convinced his colleagues were conspiring against him. He called his sister, not knowing where he was, thinking he might have been slipped something. She told him to lie down and rest. He called himself an ambulance, sent it away, drove himself to a gas station, parked the car, got out, slept behind a trash bin. A talking dog appeared and told him to enter a house. The door was unlocked. The people inside called the police, and Harris was arrested and brought to the hospital. After thirty-six hours of telephone calls his mother found him.<br>I don&#x2019;t know what breed of dog it was. I don&#x2019;t know what color the house was.

Tilden.&nbsp;But alert Republican leaders saw that if all the states still doubtful or disputed went for their candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes would be elected.&nbsp; Word was sent out to four southern states that their returns were crucial for a Hayes victory.&nbsp; Thus Chief Justice William Rehnquist begins this remarkable account of one of American's greatest political dramas, a crisis that was not resolved for nearly four months, on March 2, 1877, only two days before Inauguration Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In his gripping story, Rehnquist tells how each party maneuvered to buy votes in the southern states, how the country slid into Congressional, judicial and public turmoil, and how the creation in January of an Electoral Commission (comprised of five Democrats, five Republicans and five Supreme Court justices) was opposed by both candidates.&nbsp; When that body's deciding vote was cast by Justice Joseph Bradley, public outcry reached such a fever pitch that the presidential swearing-in had to be held on a Sunday in near secrecry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Reaching beyond the history of a contentious election, the Chief Justice describes the political climate and economy of America in the 1870's, packing his narrative with biographical sketches of the central participants and opening a window on events in that decade that have long been overlooked.&nbsp; In a compelling epilogue we learn the occasions when Presidents, ranging from George Washington to Lyndon Johnson, have asked Supreme Court justices to arbitrate disputes, settle treaties or serve on investigating commissions.&nbsp; Almost always the justices were berated and attacked for their decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Would it be better for them to have refused the president&#x2019;s request?&nbsp; The Chief Justice has some surprising answers.</p><p>William H. Rehnquist was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He earned his B.A. and M.A. in political science from Stanford University and a second M.A. from Harvard. He graduated first in his class at Stanford Law School in 1952. In 1969 Rehnquist became assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Council. He was confirmed by the Senate as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in December 1971, and took his place on the bench in January 1972. He became the sixteenth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1986.&nbsp;He lives in Arlington, Virginia.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Chapter 1<br><br>On May 10, 1876, the Centennial Exhibition, commemorating one hundred years of American independence, opened in Philadelphia-the logical place to hold such an exhibition. It was there on July 4, 1776, that the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, proclaiming in Thomas Jefferson's stirring words that "these united colonies are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent States."<br><br>Philadelphia in 1776 was not only the seat of the rudimentary national government, but also the largest city in the country. After the ratification of the Constitution in 1789, Philadelphia became the temporary capital of the infant nation, but in 1800 lost out to the new city of Washington as the site of the permanent seat of government. In time New York overtook Philadelphia as the most populous city, and both New York and Boston became more prominent centers of commerce on the East Coast. But Philadelphia rose to the occasion in 1876. Two hundred buildings were constructed in Fairmount Park, and on opening day more than 186,000 people visited the grounds. Many foreign nations took buildings to exhibit their cultures and accomplishments. Fukui Makota, the Japanese commissioner to the exposition, observed:<br><br>The first day crowds come like sheep, run here, run there, run everywhere. One man start, one thousand follow. Nobody can see anything, nobody can do anything. All rush, push, tear, shout, make plenty noise, say damn great many times, get very tired, and go home.<br><br>When the exhibition closed six months later, it had been visited by more than 10 million people. It was truly the first man-made tourist mecca in the United States.<br><br>Much had changed in the first century of America's existence. In the eighteenth century, travel by land was either on foot or horseback, or in a vehicle drawn by horse or oxen. Travel by water was accomplished by sailing vessels. But in 1806, Robert Fulton invented the steamboat, and by 1830 the first railroads were being built in the United States. Transportation was revolutionized. Samuel F. B. Morse invented the telegraph in 1843; Cyrus McCormick followed with the mechanical reaper, and Elias Howe with the sewing machine. In 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed with the driving of the Golden Spike at Promontory Point, Utah. And in the very year of the centennial, Alexander Graham Bell would patent the telephone.<br><br>The nation had also grown spectacularly in size. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 added the territory between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, and the cession following the Mexican War added the Southwest. Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876 as the thirty-eighth state; it would be known as the Centennial State.<br><br>On the exhibition's opening day President and Mrs. U. S. Grant, accompanied by the Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro and his wife, Theresa, were among the notables present. At the scheduled time the President and the Emperor opened the valves that started a huge steam engine in Machinery Hall. The steam engine in turn supplied power to hundreds of other machines at the fair. When the wheels began to turn, guns roared, church bells pealed, and whistles blew. The fair, and the Centennial, had officially begun.<br><br>Grant was in the last year of his second term as President. Elected in 1868 and reelected in 1872, he was the second Republican President; Lincoln, of course, was the first. In the two decades since its founding, the party had achieved a remarkable success. The event that precipitated its founding was the enactment by Congress of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854.<br><br>In that year Stephen A. Douglas, an able and ambitious Democratic senator from Illinois introduced in the Senate a bill providing for what he called "popular sovereignty"-and what his opponents called "squatter sovereignty"-to determine whether or not the territories of Kansas and Nebraska should allow slavery within their borders. This bill aroused instant opposition among antislavery forces in the North, because it repealed a portion of the Missouri Compromise, which Congress had enacted in 1820.<br><br>The Missouri Compromise came about when both Maine and Missouri sought admission to the Union as states. Maine would be a free state with no slavery, and Missouri would be a slave state. The Missouri Compromise admitted both states, and went on to provide that thereafter slavery would be prohibited in all territories of the United States north of the southern border of Missouri. Since both Kansas and Nebraska were north of this line, Douglas' Kansas-Nebraska Act would repeal that portion of the Missouri Compromise.<br><br>After fierce debate, the bill passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Franklin Pierce. But the antagonism aroused in the North had a lasting effect on national politics. Douglas himself, after he toured the North following the adjournment of Congress, said he could have traveled from Boston to Chicago by the light of the fires kindled to burn him in effigy.<br><br>Early in 1854, a meeting was held in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin, to oppose the extension of slavery. This led to a state convention in Madison in July which adopted the name "Republican" for the new party. A week earlier a state convention in Jackson, Michigan, adopted the same name for the new party in that state.<br><br>The fledgling party held a national convention in Philadelphia in 1856 and nominated John C. Fr�mont as its candidate for President. His Democratic opponent was James Buchanan, a long-time officeholder who had been absent as minister to England during the furor over the Kansas-Nebraska Act. In the election that fall, Buchanan carried every slave state but Maryland, together with Indiana, Illinois, and his home state of Pennsylvania. All of the other northern states voted for Fr�mont. He polled 1.34 million popular votes, losing to Buchanan, who polled 1.8 million votes.<br><br>Two days after Buchanan was inaugurated in March 1857, the Supreme Court handed down its ill-starred decision in the Dred Scott case, holding that the limitation of slavery effected by the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. This decision further inflamed northern opinion. The following year Stephen Douglas came up for reelection as United States senator in Illinois. He was opposed by Abraham Lincoln on the Republican ticket. They debated at seven different towns in downstate Illinois, thrashing out the question, among others, of the expansion of slavery. At that time senators were elected by the state legislatures rather than by popular vote. The Democrats narrowly retained control of the Illinois legislature, and in January 1859, it duly reelected Douglas.<br><br>Two years later, Lincoln and Douglas again battled each other, but this time the prize was the presidency of the United States. Douglas was not sufficiently proslavery for the southern wing of the Democratic Party, and it nominated John Breckenridge on a ticket which ran only in the South. The northern Democrats nominated Douglas. A fourth party-the Constitutional Union party-sought to ignore the issue of slavery entirely and was on the ballot in only the border states. The Republican Party was almost entirely northern in its appeal, opposing as it did any further extension of slavery in the territories.<br><br>On election day-November 6, 1860-Lincoln was elected President with a majority of the electoral votes-all of them from northern states-but only a minority of the popular vote. Even before he was inaugurated the following March, the seven states of the Deep South seceded and formed the Confederate States of America. In April 1861, the Confederate shore batteries in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, opened fire on the small Union garrison at Fort Sumter on an island in the harbor. The garrison surrendered the following day, and Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion. The Civil War had begun.<br><br>At the outbreak of the Civil War, thirty-nine-year-old Ulysses S. Grant had been a clerk in a leather store operated by two of his brothers in the Mississippi River town of Galena, Illinois. Grant had graduated from West Point with an undistinguished record, and served in the Mexican War and at Army posts in the United States until 1854, when he resigned his commission. For the next seven years, he was a farmer, a real-estate agent, a candidate for county engineer, and a clerk in a customs house. In none of these occupations was he particularly successful.<br><br>After Lincoln's call for volunteers, Grant was appointed by Illinois Governor Richard Yates to be a colonel in one of the Illinois volunteer regiments. Grant led the forces which successfully captured first Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and then Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River. He commanded Union forces at the Battle of Shiloh, and then successfully invested the southern fortress of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Vicksburg fell on July 4, 1863, thereby cutting the Confederacy in two from north to south.<br><br>Grant was promoted to major general in the regular Army. After commanding Union troops at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, he was promoted to General in Chief of the Union forces. He devised a plan to employ all of his numerically superior troops against the enemy, correctly theorizing that if he could keep the losses even, the Union forces would prevail. Battling in Virginia from the spring of 1864 until Lee's surrender at Appomattox in April 1865, Grant was the Union hero of the Civil War.<br><br>During the summer of 1864, there was considerable war-weariness in states such as Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. The war had lasted longer than most anyone expected, and Union losses were heavy in battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, mounted a stealthy but unsuccessful campaign to obtain the Republican presidential nomination himself. But Lincoln easily won renomination at the party convention in Baltimore in June. The Democrats met in Chicago in August and adopted a "peace p...</p><h2>Where Shall Wisdom Be Found?</h2><p>Journeying from the Bible to twentieth-century writings, the distinguished literary critic and author of Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human explores the ways in which literature can transform and shape one&#39;s life, discussing such topics as the Book of Job and Ecclesiastes, Plato and Homer, St. Augustine, Freud and Proust, and more. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and a former Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard. His more than twenty-five books include <i>Hamlet</i>;<i> Genius</i>; <i>How to Read and Why</i>; <i>Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human</i>; <i>The Western Canon</i>; <i>The Book of J</i>; and <i>The Anxiety of Influence</i>. He is a MacArthur Prize Fellow, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, including the Academy's Gold Medal for Belles Lettres and Criticism, the International Prize of Catalonia, and the Alfonso Reyes Prize of Mexico.Where shall wisdom be found? Harold Bloom finds it in the same place as the question -- the Book of Job -- as well as in Ecclesiastes and the writings of Plato, Homer, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Bacon, Samuel Johnson, Goethe, Emerson, Nietzsche, Freud, Proust, St. Augustine and in the Gospel of Thomas. Bloom's new book, which compares and contrasts what he calls the "wisdom writing" in these varied works, "rises out of personal need, reflecting a quest for sagacity that might solace and clarify the traumas of aging, of recovery from grave illness, and of grief for the loss of beloved friends." He tells us, "Since childhood, I have been comforted by Talmudic wisdom," and he cites wisdom writing that helped him rally when he "was ill, depressed, or weary." He also says, "We most of us know that wisdom immediately goes out the door when we are in crisis" and that he has "not found that wisdom literature is a comfort." <p>These claims may seem inconsistent, but inconsistency does not trouble him. His section on Emerson approvingly quotes that writer's "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" and alludes to Whitman's "I am large, I contain multitudes." Such familiar sayings contrast with a central delight of Bloom's book -- its inclusion of wonderful aphorisms likely to be new to many readers. One of my favorites is the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus's "Psychoanalysis is itself that disease of which it purports to be the cure," although my delight had dimmed by the time I encountered Bloom's third repetition of this remark. </p><p>As the foregoing suggests, Bloom's book is inconsistent (or multitudinous) in quality as well as in attitude. Often his fervent discussion yields shimmering insights. Consider his treatment of what he calls the "Nietzschean" position that what makes one poem more memorable than another "must be that the memorable poem, the poem that has more meaning, or starts more meaning going, is the poem that gives (or commemorates) more pain." Bloom comments, "Strong poetry is difficult, and its memorability is the consequence of a difficult pleasure, and a difficult enough pleasure is a kind of pain." What serious practitioner in any field can fail to appreciate the last part of that observation? But of course a poem's memorability is not simply a function of pain; nor is all strong or memorable poetry difficult, let alone difficult enough to support Bloom's account. Tennyson's "Flower in the Crannied Wall," a beautifully clear poem suggesting that a flower holds the secret of the universe, is just one exception to these exaggerated claims. </p><p> This is far from the only place where Bloom's confident pronouncements cry out for critical examination. Consider also his statement that "Shakespeare wisely did not" long for "a literal immortality." Why "wisely"? Slogans such as "Wisdom literature teaches us to accept natural limits" do not answer this question; they re-invite it. Nothing in Bloom's book convinces me that it is wise to accept natural limits, as opposed to valuing life enough to rage against the dying of the light. Another particularly problematic pronouncement, in the discussion of Goethe's rejected marriage proposal to a much younger woman, involves Bloom's reference to "the grotesquerie of a seventy-four-year-old groom with a nineteen-year-old bride." This categorical dismissal ignores even the possibility of a non-grotesque love that transcends externals.</p><p>Bloom's writing style likewise varies in quality. Often it is charming and pithy, as in his above-quoted observation about difficult pleasures. Yet he "awkwardizes" his book through his penchant for graceless words ending in "ize(s)," "izing" or "ization" -- including "literalization," "transcendentalizes," "ironizing," "totalizing" and "literalize." Also irritating is his repetitiveness, already noted with respect to the Kraus aphorism and emerging more gratingly in his references to "our dreadful moment in education," "all the current commissars of Resentment who throng our academies," "academic resenters who dismiss all cognitive and aesthetic standards as masks for 'racism' and 'sexism,' " "the encroachments of our Age of Resentment" and so forth. Bloom offers almost no justification for such remarks. They might appear to function largely as in-group signals to conservatives, giving his book a clubby tenor ironically reminiscent of much writing by the academic leftists he deplores. But he also inveighs against "the exploiters of the poor, who now dominate the plutocracy and oligarchy that has replaced democracy in America" and describes "the Bush bunch" as "semiliterate." Although the combination renders Bloom refreshingly hard to pigeonhole, both sorts of remarks, being formulaic, lower the book's intellectual tone. Through most of Where Shall Wisdom Be Found?, however, Bloom remains engaging enough to make you want to read him, argue with him and learn from him. </p><p>Reviewed by Felicia Nimue Ackerman <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

We flatter ourselves about the nature of free will and yet the most enormous forces&#x2015;logical, physical, metaphysical&#x2015;constrain our every action. Many writers and intellectuals have always understood this, but instead of embracing our condition we battle against it, with everyone from world conquerors to modern scientists dreaming of a "human dominion" almost comically at odds with our true state.<br> Filled with wonderful examples and drawing on the widest possible reading (from the Gnostics to Philip K. Dick), <i>The Soul of the Marionette</i> is a stimulating and engaging meditation on everything from cybernetics to the fairground marionettes of the title.</p></p><p><b>John Gray </b>is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>The Silence of Animals, The Immortalization Commission</i>,<i> Black Mass</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Straw Dogs</i>.

He now writes full-time.<p>&#x201c;[<i>The Soul of the Marionette]</i> is pervaded by the signature skepticism of its author, a British philosopher. Trapped in bodies, burdened by mortality, and &#x2018;cursed with self-reflective thought,&#x2019; we are limited in our freedom. Gray dismisses modern rationalism, with its faith in human progress, as a kind of Gnosticism made from &#x2018;scraps of decayed Christianity,&#x2019; whose central myth is that knowledge will set us free. Spirited tours through the lives and work of various artists add texture to his provocative arguments.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Illusion-piercing sobriety.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A]n intelligently written, thought-provoking book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gray connects the dots among science fiction (including that of Stanislaw Lem), Borges, the human-sacrificing Aztecs, global warming, and the loss of privacy (and freedom) that the cyberrevolution has wrought, challenging readers to make some leaps of logic and come to counterintuitive conclusions.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>A Beautiful Math: John Nash, Game Theory, and the Modern Quest for a Code of Nature</h2><p><p>Millions have seen the movie and thousands have read the book but few have fully appreciated the mathematics developed by John Nash's beautiful mind. Today Nash's beautiful math has become a universal language for research in the social sciences and has infiltrated the realms of evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and even quantum physics. John Nash won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for pioneering research published in the 1950s on a new branch of mathematics known as game theory. At the time of Nash's early work, game theory was briefly popular among some mathematicians and Cold War analysts. But it remained obscure until the 1970s when evolutionary biologists began applying it to their work. In the 1980s economists began to embrace game theory. Since then it has found an ever expanding repertoire of applications among a wide range of scientific disciplines. Today neuroscientists peer into game players' brains, anthropologists play games with people from primitive cultures, biologists use games to explain the evolution of human language, and mathematicians exploit games to better understand social networks. A common thread connecting much of this research is its relevance to the ancient quest for a science of human social behavior, or a Code of Nature, in the spirit of the fictional science of psychohistory described in the famous Foundation novels by the late Isaac Asimov. In A Beautiful Math, acclaimed science writer Tom Siegfried describes how game theory links the life sciences, social sciences, and physical sciences in a way that may bring Asimov's dream closer to reality.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Introduction</li><li>1 Smith's Hand--Searching for the Code of Nature</li><li>2 Von Neumann's Games--Game theory's origins</li><li>3 Nash's Equilibrium--Game theory's foundation</li><li>4 Smith's Strategies--Evolution, altruism, and cooperation</li><li>5 Freud's Dream--Games and the brain</li><li>6 Seldon's Solution--Game theory, culture, and human nature</li><li>7 Quetelet's Statistics and Maxwell's Molecules--Statistics and society, statistics and physics</li><li>8 Bacon's Links--Networks, society, and games</li><li>9 Asimov's Vision--Psychohistory, or sociophysics?</li><li>10 Meyer's Penny--Quantum fun and games</li><li>11 Pascal's Wager--Games, probability, information, and ignorance</li><li>Epilogue</li><li>Appendix--Calculating a Nash Equilibrium</li><li>Further Reading</li><li>Notes</li><li>Index</li></ul></p><p>You&#x2019;re a science journalist who is interested in many topics. Why game theory? <p>It&#x2019;s precisely because of the many different topics in science that game theory touches. It was invented for use in economics, but over the decades its applications have extended to biology, psychology, anthropology, neuroscience and even quantum physics. Science journalism ought to report new scientific insights, and game theory has become a spectacular tool for identifying many new insights. </p><p>What is it about science that really generates the passion necessary to explore it in such depth? </p><p>Science is the one common language for coping with the world that transcends personal preferences and prejudicial ideologies. Many people, even some scientists, nevertheless try to impose their preferences or ideologies on science. In my writings I try to cut through those prejudices to find the evidence, interpreted by sound reasoning, that tells nature&#x2019;s true story. The search for that evidence and reasoning is what drives me. </p><p>The movie or the book &#x2013; which did you like better? </p><p>The book, of course. The movie was very entertaining but bore very little resemblance to the true story and pretty much garbled what little it described about John Nash&#x2019;s math. The book was a skillfully written biography that provided some flavor of the math, although it did not explore game theory&#x2019;s widespread use across the spectrum of scientific disciplines.</p>Tom Siegfried was science editor of the Dallas Morning News for 20 years and currently writes a regular column for the science news website The Why Files.

As before, the story is told through a series of instant-message and chat-room conversations and is written entirely in that "language," which also adds to its appeal. Suddenly, 200-plus pages don't seem like a lot, and reluctant readers gain a sense of achievement having breezed through what appears to be quite a lengthy novel.

Knowledge of those laws is what allows us to accomplish anything in life. Our spiritual and religious life is no different. Spiritual awakening is also managed by laws in nature. On every level of existence, there are basic facts that manage creation, development, decay, and death. Our consciousness or soul is no exception to these facts, and by knowing about them, we can achieve our complete development as a human being. Samael Aun Weor explains the fundamental laws and energies that we need to consciously harness in order to reach our full potential. These are the same energies that fuel the creation of any organism, from the smallest atom to the most expansive universe. The human being is called to be a radiant king or queen of nature, but to arrive at that level, one must know how.</p><p>The name Samael Aun Weor is Hebrew and is pronounced sam-ayel on vay-ohr. Samael Aun Weor wrote over sixty books, gave thousands of lectures, and formed the worldwide Gnostic Movement, whose members number in the millions. And yet, in spite of his wisdom and generosity towards mankind, he said: &#34;Do not follow me. I am just a signpost. Reach your own Self-realization.&#34; His lifelong mission was to deliver to humanity the total and exact science to develop the complete human being, that mysterious and ancient wisdom long hidden in the bosom of every great religion.If we consider a man as half a being and woman as the other half of that Being, we then arrive by logical deduction to the amorous attraction of the opposites. <br><br>Thirsty for love, souls always wander in search of their other half, their twin soul, from which they have been separated since the dawn of creation. <br><br>On the path of life we always need another being who can fill us, who can supply with complete exactitude that which we lack, not only in the physiological aspect, but also in the psychosomatic and spiritual aspects. <br><br>Each of our physical and psychic functions needs a very human supplement; this is a natural necessity in every living being. <br><br>The mutual combination of elements of nature, the chemical weddings, the sexual combination of opposed elements in order to achieve a perfect whole, constitutes the living foundation of everything that is, of everything that has been, and of everything that will be. <br><br>It is demonstrated that the chemical elements are attracted and amorously combined in accordance with the complementary number of electrons. <br><br>Every scientist of chemistry knows by means of observation and experience that once the perfect sheath is settled by a number of electrons, sodium with a leftover electron is sexually united to chlorine, which lacks an electron. What is astounding about this, what is marvelous, is that the sodium with an extra electron can never in life be combined with other alkalis that are composed in an analogous manner. <br><br>In the depths of these wonders, these prodigies of love, we find the marriage of elements and the fundamental stone upon which all chemistry rests. <br><br>Without any exaggeration we can affirm that this same principle of sexual attraction of the opposites is always applicable, without any exception, to the attraction and marriage of men and women.</p><h2>RHS Propagating Plants</h2><p>From trees and shrubs to culinary herbs, this unequalled practical guide from the RHS offers invaluable advice on the successful propagation of all garden plants.

Gertrude Vanderbilt, Otto Kahn, Henry Luce, Diego Rivera, Georgia O'Keeffe, even Benito Mussolini all play crucial, and often unexpected, roles in this saga. But at the heart of the story are four remarkable individuals: John D. Rockefeller Jr., the timid son of the world's richest man, whose greatest accomplishment turns out to be something he had never intended; his son Nelson, who launched his own imperial career by seizing control of this vast enterprise; the rude, vain, but dazzlingly creative real-estate genius John R. Todd; and Raymond Hood, a scamp, a provocateur, a drinker-and the greatest skyscraper architect America has ever known. Brilliantly weaving together multiple narrative lines and a wealth of historic detail, <i>Great Fortune</i> is a vast tapestry of New York in its first flush of world-dominating wealth and power.</p><p>Those of us who love New York tend to love the city passionately, for its past as well as its present. Daniel Okrent's <i>Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center</i> is a book for New Yorkers from Ashtabula to Zimbabwe: a study of ambition, audacity, and deal-making on a grand scale that led to the construction of some of the most famous skyscrapers in the world. The cast of characters includes not only the many and diverse members of the Rockefeller family, but other powerful New York institutions such as Columbia University, the Metropolitan Opera, the Museum of Modern Art, and <i>The New York Times</i>--not to mention the radical Mexican artist Diego Rivera, the <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist William Steig, the Marx Brothers, and a bevy of "Rockettes." Okrent's narrative neatly balances the epic and the intimate; he offers both authoritative pronouncements on modern architecture and reams of good gossip. Like New York itself, <i>Great Fortune</i> contains multitudes: densely packed, it remains surprisingly--and welcomingly--commodious. <i>--Tim Page</i>Daniel Okrent is a prizewinning journalist, a frequent television commentator, and the author of several highly acclaimed books.

His writing has been described as &#x201c;humane, devastating, and beautiful&#x201d; by Elizabeth Gilbert, &#x201c;spellbinding&#x201d; by Anthony Doerr, and &#x201c;expansive and joyful&#x201d; by George Saunders. In the seventeen wide-ranging essays collected for the first time in <i>Love and Other Ways of Dying, </i>he brings his full literary powers to bear, pondering happiness and grief, memory and the redemptive power of human connection.<br><br> In the remote Ukranian countryside, Paterniti picks apples (and faces mortality) with a real-life giant; in Nanjing, China, he confronts a distraught jumper on a suicide bridge; in Dodge City, Kansas, he takes up residence at a roadside hotel and sees, firsthand, the ways in which the racial divide turns neighbor against neighbor. In each instance, Paterniti illuminates the full spectrum of human experience, introducing us to unforgettable everyday people and bygone legends, exploring the big ideas and emotions that move us. Paterniti reenacts Fran�ois Mitterrand&#x2019;s last meal in a rustic dining room in France and drives across America with Albert Einstein&#x2019;s brain in the trunk of his rental car, floating in a Tupperware container. He delves with heartbreaking detail into the aftermath of a plane crash off the coast of Nova Scotia, an earthquake in Haiti, and a tsunami in Japan&#x2014;and, in searing swirls of language, unearths the complicated, hidden truths these moments of extremity teach us about our ability to endure, and to love.<br><br> Michael Paterniti has spent the past two decades grappling with some of our most powerful subjects and incomprehensible events, taking an unflinching point of view that seeks to edify as it resists easy answers. At every turn, his work attempts to make sense of both love and loss, and leaves us with a profound sense of what it means to be human. As he writes in the Introduction to this book, &#x201c;The more we examine the grooves and scars of this life, the more free and complete we become.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Praise for Michael Paterniti and <i>Love and Other Ways of Dying<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;One of the best books I&#x2019;ve read all year . . .

The village disappeared behind skeins of fog. Fishermen came and went in boats named Reverence, Granite Prince, Souwester. The ocean, which was green and wild, carried the vessels out past Jackrock Bank toward Pearl Island and the open sea. In the village, on the shelf of rock, stood a lighthouse, whitewashed and octagonal with a red turret. Its green light beamed over the green sea, and sometimes, in the thickest fog or heaviest storm, that was all the fishermen had of land, this green eye dimly flashing in the night, all they had of home and how to get there&#x2014;�that was the question. There were nights when that was the only question.<br><br>This northerly village, this place here of sixty people, the houses and fences and clotheslines, was set among solid rocks breaching from the earth. It was as if a pod of whales had surfaced just as the ocean turned to land and then a village was built on their granite backs. By the weathered fishing shacks were rusted anchors like claws and broken traps and hills of coiled line. Come spring, wildflowers appeared by the clapboard church. The priest said mass. A woman drew back a curtain. A man hanged himself by the bridge. Travelers passing through agreed it was the prettiest earthly spot, snapping pictures as if gripped by palsy, nearly slipping off the rocks into the frigid waves.<br><br>Late summer, a man and woman were making love under the eaves of a garishly painted house that looked out on the lighthouse&#x2014;�green light flashing&#x2014;�when a feeling suddenly passed into them, a feeling unrelated to their lovemaking, in direct physical opposition to it: an electrical charge so strong they could taste it, feel it, the hair standing up on their arms, just as it does before lightning strikes. And the fishermen felt it, too, as they went to sea and returned, long ago resigned to the fact that you can do nothing to stop the ocean or the sky from what it will do. Now they, too, felt the shove and lock of some invisible metallic bit in their mouths. The feeling of being surrounded by towering waves.<br><br>Yes, something terrible was moving this way. There was a low ceiling of clouds, an intense, creeping darkness, that electrical taste. By the lighthouse, if you had been standing beneath the flashing green light on that early-�September night, in that plague of clouds, you would have heard the horrible grinding sound of some wounded winged creature, listened to it trail out to sea as it came screeching down from the heavens, down through molecule and current, until everything went silent.<br><br>That is, the waves still crashed up against the granite rock, the lighthouse groaned, a cat yowled somewhere near the church, but beyond, out at sea, there was silence. Seconds passed, disintegrating time . . . and then, suddenly, an explosion of seismic strength rocked the houses of Peggy&#x2019;s Cove. One fisherman thought it was a bomb; another was certain the End had arrived. The lovers clasped tightly&#x2014;�their bodies turning as frigid as the ocean.<br><br>That&#x2019;s how it began.<br>It began before that, too, in other cities of the world, with plans hatched at dinner tables or during long-�distance calls, plans for time together and saving the world, for corralling AIDS and feeding the famine-�stricken and family reunions. What these people held in common at first&#x2014;�these diplomats and scientists and students, these spouses and parents and children&#x2014;�was an elemental feeling, that buzz of excitement derived from holding a ticket to some foreign place. And what distinguished that ticket from billions of other tickets was the simple designation of a number: SR111. New York to Geneva, following the Atlantic coast up along Nova Scotia, then out over Greenland and Iceland and En- gland, and then down finally into Switzerland, on the best airline in the world. Seven hours if the tailwinds were brisk. There in time for breakfast on the lake.<br><br>In one row would be a family with two grown kids, a computer-�genius son and an attorney daughter, setting out on their hiking holiday to the Bernese Oberland. In another would be a woman whose boyfriend was planning to propose to her when she arrived in Geneva. Sitting here would be a world-�famous scientist, with his world-�famous scientist wife. And there would be the boxer&#x2019;s son, a man who had grown to look like his legendary father, the same thick brow and hard chin, the same mournful eyes, on a business trip to promote his father&#x2019;s tomato sauce.<br><br>Like lovers who haven&#x2019;t yet met or one-�day neighbors living now in different countries, tracing their route to one another, each of them moved toward the others without knowing it, in these cities and towns, grasping airline tickets. Some, like the Swiss tennis pro, would miss the flight, and others, without tickets, would be bumped from other flights onto this one at the last minute, feeling lucky to have made it, feeling chosen.<br><br>In the hours before the flight, a young blond woman with blue, almost Persian eyes said goodbye to her boyfriend in the streets of Manhattan and slipped into a cab. A fifty-�six-�year-�old man had just paid a surprise visit to see his brother&#x2019;s boat, a refurbished sloop, on the Sound, just as his two brothers and his elderly mother came in from a glorious day on the water, all that glitter and wind, and now he was headed back to Africa, to the parched veldts and skeletal victims, to the disease and hunger, back to all this worrying for the world.<br><br>Somewhere else, a man packed&#x2014;�his passport, his socks&#x2014;�then went to the refrigerator to pour himself a glass of milk. His three kids roughhoused in the other room. His wife complained that she didn&#x2019;t want him to fly, didn&#x2019;t want him to leave on this business trip. On the refrigerator was a postcard, once sent by friends, of a faraway fishing village&#x2014;�the houses and fences and clotheslines, the ocean and the lighthouse and the green light flashing. He had looked at that postcard every day since it had been taped there. A beautiful spot. Something about it. Could a place like that really exist?<br><br>All of these people, it was as if they were all turning to gold, all marked with an invisible X on their foreheads, as of course we are, too, the place and time yet to be determined. Yes, we are burning down; time is disintegrating. There were 229 people who owned cars and houses, slept in beds, had bought clothes and gifts for this trip, some with price tags still on them&#x2014;�and then they were gone.<br><br>Do you remember the last time you felt the wind? Or touched your lips to the head of your child? Can you remember the words she said as she last went, a ticket in hand?<br><br>Every two minutes an airliner moves up the Atlantic coast, tracing ribboned contrails, moving through kingdoms in the air demarcated by boundaries, what are called corridors and highways by the people who control the sky. In these corridors travel all the planes of the world, jetliners pushing the speed of sound at the highest altitudes, prop planes puttering at the lowest, and a phylum in between of Cessnas and commuters and corporate jets&#x2014;�all of them passing over the crooked-�armed peninsulas and jagged coastlines and, somewhere, too, this northern village as it appears and disappears behind skeins of fog.<br><br>The pilot&#x2014;�a thin-�faced, handsome Swiss man with penetrating brown eyes and a thick mustache&#x2014;�was known among his colleagues as a consummate pilot. He&#x2019;d recently completed a promotional video for his airline. In it, he&#x2014;�the energetic man named Urs&#x2014;�kisses his beautiful wife goodbye at their home before driving off, then he is standing on the tarmac, smiling, gazing up at his plane, and then in the cockpit, in full command, flipping toggles, running checks, in command, toggles, lights, check, command.<br><br>So now here they were, in their corridor, talking, Urs and his copilot, Stephan. About their kids; both had three. About the evening&#x2019;s onboard dinner. It was an hour into the flight, the plane soaring on autopilot, the engine a quiet drone beneath the noise in the main cabin, the last lights of New England shimmering out the west side of the aircraft, and suddenly there was a tickling smell, rising from somewhere into the cockpit, an ominous wreathing of&#x2014;�really, how could it be?&#x2014;�smoke. Toggles, lights, check, but the smoke kept coming. The pilot ran through his emergency checklists, switching various electrical systems on and off to isolate the problem. But the smoke kept coming. He was breathing rapidly, and the copilot, who wasn&#x2019;t, said, We have a problem.<br><br>Back in the cabin, the passengers were sipping wine and soda, penning postcards at thirty-�three thousand feet. In first class, some donned airline slippers and supped on hors d&#x2019;oeuvres while gambling on the computer screens in front of them. Slots, blackjack, keno. Others reclined and felt the air move beneath them&#x2014;�a Saudi prince, the world-�famous scientist, the UN field director, the boxer&#x2019;s son, the woman with Persian eyes&#x2014;�an awesome feeling of power, here among the stars, plowing for Europe, halfway between the polar cap and the moon, gambling and guzzling and gourmandizing, oblivious as even now, the pilot was on the radio, using the secret language of the sky to declare an emergency:<br><br>Pan, pan, pan, said Urs. We have smoke in the cockpit, request deviate, immediate return to a convenient place. I guess Boston. (Toggles, lights, check, breathe.)<br><br>Would you prefer to go in to Halifax? said air traffic control, a calm voice from a northern place called Moncton, a man watching a green hexagon crawl across a large round screen, this very flight moving across the screen, a single clean green light.<br><br>Affirmative for one-�eleven heavy, said the pilot. We have the oxygen mask on. Go ahead with the weather&#x2014;�<br><br>Could I have the number of souls on board . . . for emergency services? chimed in Halifax control.<br><br>Roger, said the pilot, but then he never answered the question, working frantically down his checklist, circling back over the ocean to release tons of fuel to lighten the craft for an emergency landing, the plane dropping to nineteen thousand feet, then twelve thousand, and ten thousand. An alarm sounded, the autopilot shut down. Lights fritzed on and off in both the cockpit and the cabin, flight attendants rushed through the aisles, one of the three engines quit in what was now becoming a huge electrical meltdown.<br><br>Urs radioed something in German, emergency checklist air conditioning smoke. Then in English, Sorry . . . Maintaining at ten thousand feet, his voice urgent, the words blurring. The smoke was thick, the heat increasing, the checklists, the bloody checklists . . . leading nowhere, leading&#x2014;�We are declaring emergency now at, ah, time, ah, zero-�one-�two-�four . . . We have to land immediate&#x2014;�<br><br>The instrument panel&#x2014;�bright digital displays&#x2014;�went black. Both pilot and copilot were now breathing frantically.<br><br>Then nothing.<br><br>Radio contact ceased. Temperatures in the cockpit were rising precipitously; aluminum fixtures began to melt. It&#x2019;s possible that one of the pilots, or both, simply caught fire. At air traffic control in Moncton, the green hexagon flickered off the screen. There was silence. One controller began trembling, another wept.<br><br>It was falling.<br><br>Six minutes later, SR111 plunged into the dark sea.<br><br>The medical examiner woke to a ringing phone, the worst way to wake. Ten-�something on the clock, or was it eleven? The phone ringing, in the house where he lived alone, or rather with his two retrievers, but alone, too, without wife or woman. He lived near the village with the lighthouse, had moved here less than three years ago from out west, had spent much of his life rolling around, weird things following him, demons and disasters. Had a train wreck once, in Great Britain, early in his career, a Sunday night, university students coming back to London after a weekend at home. Train left the tracks at speed. He&#x2019;d never seen anything like that in his life&#x2014;�sixty dead, decapitations, severed arms and legs. These kids, hours before whole and happy, now disassembled. Time disintegrating in the small fires of the wreckage. After the second night, while everyone kept their stiff upper lips, he sobbed uncontrollably. He scared himself&#x2014;�not so much because he was sobbing, but because he couldn&#x2019;t stop.<br><br>There&#x2019;d been a tornado in Edmonton&#x2014;�twenty-�three dead. And then another train wreck in western Canada, in the hinterlands fifty miles east of Jasper. Twenty-�five dead in a ravine. He&#x2019;d nearly been drummed out of the job for his handling of that one. The media swarmed to photograph mangled bodies, and the medical examiner, heady from all the attention and a bit offended by it, knowing he shouldn&#x2019;t, stuffed some towels and linens on a litter, draped them with a sheet, and rolled the whole thing out for the cameras. Your dead body, gentlemen.<br><br>Later, when they found out&#x2014;�oh, they hated him for that. Called for his head.<br><br>This had been a frustrating day, though, driving up to New Glasgow, waiting to take the stand to testify in the case of a teenage killer, waiting, waiting, four, five, six hours, time passing, nothing to do in that town except pitter here and there, waiting. Got off the stand around six, home by nine, deeply annoyed, too late to cook, got into the frozen food, then to bed, reading the paper, drifting, reading, drifting. And now the phone was ringing, a woman from the office: A jet was down. Without thinking, he said, It&#x2019;s a mistake. Call me back if anything comes of it. Set the phone in its cradle, and a minute later it rang again.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a problem here, she said.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll get on my way, he said, and hung up. He automatically put a suitcase on the bed, an overnight bag, and then it dawned on him: There&#x2019;d been no talk about numbers yet, the possible dead. There could be hundreds, he knew that, yes, he did know that now, didn&#x2019;t he? He walked back and forth between his cupboard and his bed, flustered, disbelieving, maybe hundreds, and then the adrenaline released, with hypodermic efficiency. Hundreds of bodies&#x2014;�and each one of them would touch his hands. And he would have to touch them, identify them, confer what remained of them to some resting place. He would have to bear witness to the horrible thing up close, what it did up close, examine it, notate, dissect, and, all the while, feel what it did, feel it in each jagged bone.<br><br>Flustered, disbelieving, it took him forty minutes to pack his bag with a couple of pairs of khakis, some underwear, shirts, a pair of comfortable shoes, some shaving gear, should have taken five minutes.</p><h2>Your New Job Title Is &#34;Accomplice&#34;: A Dilbert Book (Volume 40)</h2><p>Dubbed "the cartoon hero of the workplace" by the <i>San Francisco Examiner,</i> Dilbert is the cubicle-bound star of the most photocopied, pinned-up, downloaded, faxed, and e-mailed comic strip in the world.<br><br>As fresh a look at the inanity of office life as it brought to the comics pages when it first appeared in 1989, this 40th AMP&nbsp;Dilbert collection comically confirms to the working public that we all really know what's going on.

Shakespeare wore a single earring in one ear, following popular custom. The nose is a voice resonator and bony shield to protect the eyes, in addition to being an organ of smell and taste. These are some of the facts found in this head-to-toe scrutiny of the human body by the author of The Naked Ape. Twenty chapters scan the brow, eyes, mouth, shoulders, breasts, genitals, legs, feet and so forth. This engrossing survey reflects the biases of the "naked ape" school of anthropology criticized by many scientists. Morris argues that baldness is a display signal indicating male dominance "because it is linked with high levels of sex hormone . . . and increases with advancing age." He claims that the female buttocks is the "probable" source of the valentine symbol. Questionable theories like these, often presented as fact, are sprinkled throughout.

Such a world requires a firm hand and a guiding light.

Banks in 1987. He is now widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful, innovative and exciting writers of his generation. Iain Banks lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. Find out more about Iain M. Banks at www.iainbanks.net.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Iain Banks is well known for one crotchet that every reviewer of his work is obliged to mention: Under this name, the popular Scottish author writes edgy mainstream fiction, often psychological thrillers such as his unsettling first book, "The Wasp Factory" (1984). But as Iain M. Banks he produces science fiction, usually glorious space-operatic science fiction involving a future civilization called the Culture. In these latter books, human beings and sentient AI machines coexist as equal citizens of a pan-galactic utopia, one that has eliminated want, disease and other common social ills. The first two novels in the series are the evocatively titled "Consider Phlebas" -- a two-word quote from T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" -- and "The Player of Games." So, given the presence of that middle initial M., Banks clearly signals that "Transition" should be regarded as a science-fiction novel, even if it's not part of the Culture universe. Yet in Britain "Transition" was published sans M., as a literary thriller or apocalyptic fable, with contemporary social and political commentary attached. It is certainly that, too. In whichever edition you read it, though, Banks's new novel is wildly entertaining, albeit a bit confusing at first. The confusion initially arises because the narrative shifts among several voices and points of view. To all appearances the book seems to be juxtaposing at least four unrelated stories. In the sections labeled "Patient 8262," a man is being cared for in a hospital where the staff speaks a language he doesn't understand. He believes himself to be some kind of super-secret agent, now in hiding from his enemies. In those sections titled "Adrian," we follow a smart, ambitious young drug dealer as he climbs to social and financial success in contemporary London. From the pages assigned to "The Philosopher," we learn about the early years and background of a professional torturer. Only in those sections titled "The Transitionary" and "Madame d'Ortolan" does the novel grow clearly science fictional. Using the common sci-fi notion of the multiverse, Banks posits that there are an infinite number of parallel Earths. Our world -- the world of the Twin Towers and the Wall Street meltdown -- is one of them. But on another Earth, Christian Terrorism poses a serious threat to Western civilized values. There, public outrage at airport bombings has actually led to the socially condoned use of torture on prisoners. It couldn't happen here, of course. Still, the myriad Earths are superficially similar if hardly equal. On the all-important one called Calbefraques certain people have developed the power to shift their consciousness from one body to another. By taking over the "husk" of a person living in an alternate time-stream, a specially trained operative can "transition" between worlds. Obviously, such power must be controlled and carefully safeguarded by the Concern. This governing body -- helped by "foreseers" -- aims to do good for the various Earths, to nudge history down one path rather than another, to benefit multiple societies by carefully timed interventions in people's lives. In short, the body-snatchers "fix what is broken" or "stop things about to break from breaking in the first place." A brilliant young doctor halts to listen to a colleague's suddenly odd remarks -- and isn't killed when the elevator he was about to enter breaks free of its cables and plunges 20 stories to the ground. A mysterious stranger saves a Latin American teenager from being raped -- and thus she will grow up to become a world-renowned professor of psycho-semantics rather than commit suicide before the age of 20. Sometimes, though, the Concern decides that the only useful adjustment is "elision," i.e., the murder of a brutal dictator, for example, or the elimination of a fanatical billionaire with plans to start a political party to rid the United States of non-Aryans. For the most difficult or highly sensitive of these operations, the Concern relies on Temudjin Oh. Of Mongolian extraction, Oh lives, as he says, "an orderly, even quiet life, as entirely befits somebody who spends potentially highly disorienting amounts of time flitting between one world and the next, too often for the unfortunate purpose of killing people." One day Oh is called to a special meeting with Madame d'Ortolan, who countermands his most recent instructions with verbal orders to "elide" (kill) a half-dozen members of the Concern's Central Council. He questions the orders, but this imperious dragon lady reiterates that she and her colleagues have approved this course of action, reminds him that he is sworn to obey his superiors, and duly sends the assassin off to fulfill his mission. Nonetheless, Oh is troubled. Many years earlier he had been the student of the very sexy Mrs. Mulverhill, who has since become a traitor and outlaw, apparently determined to bring down the Concern. Mrs. Mulverhill insists that the powerful Madame d'Ortolan, now in absolute control of the Central Council, has a secret agenda. But what is it? So far Oh's former teacher can only speculate, though she has personal knowledge of hideous experiments being conducted on the apparently autistic to bring out latent but weird mental powers. Meanwhile, Banks keeps interrupting this science-fictional roller coaster with highly realistic accounts of Adrian snorting coke, sweet-talking an elderly hedge fund manager and generally being a joy to listen to, if impossible to quote at length here because of his fondness for various obscenities. When Adrian meets a "bint" in a bar, he tell us that "I . . . gave her the first-level cheeky smile, which has been known to melt many a girl's heart and other parts and which I am not ashamed to admit I have practised in the mirror, to get the effect just right. Hey -- it's for them in the end." Brazenly self-centered but more obnoxious than he realizes, Adrian almost steals the book away. Nonetheless, Banks will suddenly shift from Adrian's cocky monologues to the Philosopher debating the nature of justice with a prisoner, before going on to the mental confusion of Patient 8262, who is trying to figure out what is actually going on in the hospital where he is virtually imprisoned. And then, before too long, it will be back to the cat-and-mouse politics in Calbefraques. Whom can Temudjin Oh really trust? Certainly longtime readers of science fiction will find much that is vaguely familiar in "Transition." The decadent civilization of Calbefraques and the act of "transitioning" both call to mind Alfred Bester's seminal masterpiece, "The Stars My Destination." The mental control of other people's bodies and the sparring between powerful super-minds suggests Dan Simmons's "Carrion Comfort." The novel's overall current of paranoia adds a soupcon of "The Matrix" and Philip K. Dick. But what of the other seemingly realistic, even naturalistic sections of "Transition"? What of the graphic account of the Philosopher's first act of torture? What of the greed, egotism and libertarianism espoused by Adrian? What about Patient 8262's growing suspicion that he might be delusional? And what, too, of all the talk about solipsism and the tendency of power to craze as well as corrupt? Is there a pattern here? Of course there is. Suffice it to say that surprises are in store, as well as much slightly kinky lovemaking, a deliberate disordering of the senses in several bravura stylistic passages and, finally, a classic white-knuckle climax on the Rialto Bridge in Venice.

Reprint.</p><p>Tucked away into the verdant folds of the Cascade foothills east of Eugene, Oregon, there is a forest that has been forming since before Columbus first set foot in the New World. The 16,000-acre Andrews Experimental Forest is an <i>old-growth</i> forest, a description largely unknown to the American public until the late 1980s, when the spotted owl swooped into notoriety. In some forestry circles, other adjectives like <i>decadent</i> are used to describe this forest's towering Douglas firs, western red cedars, and western hemlocks--that is, a forest that has reached maximum wood fiber capacity. Loggers contend that allowing such giant trees to die, rot, and fall over is a waste of resources. "I'm clearcutting to save the forest," declared a partisan newspaper ad in the go-go timber years of the 1970s, when old growth was liquidated at an unprecedented rate to make way for managed forest crops. The only problem with this view is that it misses the forest for the trees. In <i>The Hidden Forest</i>, Jon Luoma takes us below--and above--the canopy to view the natural processes of an ancient forest and visit with the scientists working there.<p> The Andrews is unique in that it brings together scientists from diverse fields to join a collaborative effort, with the end result being an entire ecosystem under the microscope. </p><blockquote>In the heart of summer research season, scientists can be found burrowing in the soil under logs; or trapping insects fifteen stories or more up in the tree canopy with the aid of rock-climbing gear; or scrambling crablike in a neoprene wet suit in a rushing, buffeting mountain stream....</blockquote> One optimistic scientist is examining the process of rot in fallen trees, a study that will take two centuries in the case of these old-growth logs, meaning that "it will be up to the contemporaries of [his] great-great-great-great-grandchildren to complete the analysis he has begun." Others are busy identifying thousands of species new to science. To date, this research has yielded a "wellspring of key discoveries," turning the environmental and scientific communities upside-down. But meanwhile, the last remnants of unprotected Pacific old-growth forest continue to fall to the chainsaw. "It remains to be seen," writes Luoma, "how long it might take some entrenched U.S. Forest Service managers to fully embrace more ecosystem-based approaches." <i>The Hidden Forest</i> is testimony as to why sooner is better than later. <i>--Langdon Cook</i>Jon R.

Moore currently resides in Northampton, England.<i>Starred Review.</i> [Signature]<i>Reviewed by</i> Neil GaimanAlmost 10 years before his <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> took many of the figures of Victorian popular fiction on a remarkable romp, Alan Moore, in collaboration with underground artist Melinda Gebbie, began <i>Lost Girls</i>, with a similar, although less fantastical, conceit: that the three women whose adventures in girlhood may have inspired respectively, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, <i>Peter Pan and Wendy</i> and the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, meet in a Swiss hotel shortly before the first World War. Wendy, Dorothy and Alice, three very different women&#x2014;one jaded and old; one trapped in a frigid adulthood; the last a spunky but innocent young American good-time girl&#x2014;provide each other with the liberation they need, while also providing very different (and, for this <i>is </i>a pornography, very sexual) versions of the stories we associate with them. We go with the girls, in memory, to the incidents that became the Rabbit Hole, Oz and Neverland. As a formal exercise in pure comics, <i>Lost Girls </i>is as good as anything Moore has written. (One of my favorite moments: a husband and wife trapped in a frozen, loveless, sexless relationship, conduct a stiff conversation, laced with unconscious puns and wordplay, moving into positions that cause their shadows to appear to copulate wildly, finding the physical passion that the people are denied.) In addition to being a master-class in comics technique, <i>Lost Girls</i> is also an education in Edwardian smut&#x2014;Gebbie and Moore pastiche the pornography of the period, taking in everything from <i>The Oyster</i> to the <i>Venus and Tannhauser</i> period work of Aubrey BeardsleyMelinda Gebbie was a strange and inspired choice as collaborator for Moore. She draws real people, with none of the exaggerated bodies usual to superhero or porno comics. Gebbie's people, drawn for the most part in gentle crayons, have human bodies,.<i>Lost Girls</i> is a bittersweet, beautiful, exhaustive, problematic, occasionally exhausting work. It succeeded for me wonderfully as a true graphic novel. If it failed for me, it was as smut. The book, at least in large black-and-white photocopy form, was not a one-handed read. It was too heady and strange to appreciate or to experience on a visceral level. (Your mileage may vary; porn is, after all, personal.)Top Shelf has chosen to package it elegantly and expensively, presenting it to the world not as pornography, but as erotica. It is one of the tropes of pure pornography that events are without consequence. No babies, no STDs, no trauma, no memories best left unexamined. <i>Lost Girls</i> parts company from pure porn in precisely that place: it's all about consequences, not to mention war, music, love, lust, repression and memory. <i>(Aug.)</i><i>Neil Gaiman is the author of the bestsellers</i> Anansi Boys <i>and</i> American Gods<i>.

Focusing on the life of the mind helps us to know God better, love him more, and care for the world. Along with an emphasis on emotions and the experience <em>of</em> God, we also need to practice careful thinking <em>about</em> God. Piper contends that &#x201c;thinking is indispensable on the path to passion for God.&#x201d; So how are we to maintain a healthy balance of mind and heart, thinking and feeling?</p> <p>Piper urges us to <em>think</em> for the glory of God. He demonstrates from Scripture that glorifying God with our minds and hearts is not either-or, but both-and. Thinking carefully about God fuels passion and affections for God. Likewise, Christ-exalting emotion leads to disciplined thinking.</p> <p>Readers will be reminded that &#x201c;the mind serves to know the truth that fuels the fires of the heart.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><strong>JOHN PIPER</strong> is pastor for preaching and vision at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis.

John Piper reminds us in this excellent book that what we need isn&#x2019;t less thinking, but clearer, biblical, and more God-centered thinking.

He lives in Blandford Forum, UK.<br><br>&#xfeff;Gr 9 Up&#x2014;In a bizarre, topsy-turvy world where children make parents, and knives rain from the sky, Scarper Lee's deathday looms before him like a ticking time bomb. The teen has resolved himself to his fate&#x2014;even if his hairdryer mother and makeshift wind-powered brass sculpture father haven't quite yet&#x2014;when new girl Vera Pike arrives and throws a wrench into the status quo. When his father disappears (though he's usually chained in the shed), Scarper, Vera, and new friend Castro Smith (a boy who speaks in lucid riddles and has a knack for repairing kitchen gods) escape their daily routine to find him. During their journey, they face a field of abandoned mother creatures, a gaggle of elderly police officers, and their own mortality. In an Odyssey-like quest, the trio searches for the fabled Motherless Oven, where humans were supposedly first fashioned, and hopefully the answer to all of their prayers. Heady topics such as existentialism, destiny, religion, and love make this a quirky title rife for discussion. Davis's dark and shadow-filled art appropriately mindbends and illuminates the text. The variation in panels quickens and pulls back the pace in this enigmatic tale, with the right amount of imagery left open for interpretation. For fans of Farel Dalrymple's The Wrenchies (First Second), David Almond's novels, and teens who enjoy graphic novels that are disturbing and beautiful all at once.&#x2014;Shelley Diaz, School Library Journal</p><h2>Churchill, Winston S.

Suddenly the boy who had scrapped his way through post-war Leningrad schoolyards, dreaming of ruling the world, was a public figure, and his popularity soared. Russia and an infatuated West were determined to see the progressive leader of their dreams, even as with ruthless efficiency Putin dismantled the country&#39;s media, wrested control and wealth from the country&#39;s burgeoning business class, and decimated the fragile mechanisms of democracy. Within a few brief years, virtually every obstacle to his unbridled control was removed and every opposing voice silenced, with political rivals and critics driven into exile or to the grave. As a journalist living in Moscow, Masha Gessen experienced this history firsthand, and for The Man Without a Face she has drawn on information and sources no other writer has tapped. Her horrifying and spellbinding account of how this &#39;faceless&#39; man manoeuvred his way into absolute - and absolutely corrupt - power will stand as a classic of narrative non-fiction.</p><p>Masha Gessen is a Russian-American journalist and author, and editor of the Russian-language Snob magazine, aimed at Russians living abroad. She has contributed to Granta, Slate and the New Statesman, among other publications. She is the author of several previous books, most recently Perfect Rigor and Blood Matters. She lives in Moscow.ON MAY 13, 2000, six days after he was inaugurated, Putin signed his first decree and proposed a set of bills, all of them aimed, as he stated, at &#x201c;strengthening vertical power.&#x201d; They served as the beginning of a profound restructuring of Russia&#x2019;s federal composition, or, put another way, as the beginning of the dismantling of the country&#x2019;s democratic structures. One of the bills replaced elected members of the upper house of the parliament with appointed ones: two from each of Russia&#x2019;s<br> eighty-nine regions, one appointed by the governor of the region and one by the legislature. Another bill allowed elected governors to be removed from office on mere suspicion of wrongdoing, without a<br> court decision. The decree established seven presidential envoys to seven large territories of the country, each comprising about a dozen regions, each of which had its elected legislature and governor. The envoys, appointed by the president, would supervise the work of<br> elected governors.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem Putin was trying to address with these measures was real. In 1998, when Russia defaulted on its foreign debt and plummeted into a profound economic crisis, Moscow had given the<br> regions wide latitude in managing their budgets, collecting taxes, setting tariffs, and creating economic policies. For this and other reasons, the Russian Federation had become as loose as a structure can be while remaining, at least nominally, a single state. Because the problem was real, Russia&#x2019;s liberal politicians&#x2014;who still believed Putin to be one of them&#x2014;did not criticize his solution to it, even though it clearly contradicted the spirit and possibly also the letter of the 1993 constitution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Putin appointed the seven envoys. Only two of them were civilians&#x2014;and one of these very much appeared to have the biography of an undercover KGB agent. Two were KGB officers from Leningrad, one was a police general, and two more were army generals who had commanded the troops in Chechnya. So Putin appointed generals to watch over popularly elected governors&#x2014;who could also now be removed by the federal government.<br> &nbsp;<br> The lone voice against these new laws belonged to Boris Berezovsky, or, rather, to my old acquaintance Alex Goldfarb, the �migr� former dissident who just a year earlier had been willing to be charmed by Putin. He authored a brilliant critique of the decree and the bills that was published under Berezovsky&#x2019;s byline in <i>Kommersant</i>, the popular daily newspaper Berezovsky owned. &#x201c;I assert that the most important outcome of the Yeltsin presidency has been the change in mentality of millions of people: those who used to be slaves fully dependent on the will of their boss or the state became free people who depend only on themselves,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;In a democratic society, laws exist to protect individual freedom. . . . The legislation you have proposed will place severe limitations on the independence and civil freedoms of tens of thousands of top-level Russian politicians, forcing<br> them to take their bearings from a single person and follow his will. But we have been through this!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> No one took notice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bills sailed through the parliament. The installation of the envoys drew no protest. What happened next was exactly what Berezovsky&#x2019;s letter had predicted, and it went far beyond the legal<br> measures introduced by Putin. Something shifted, instantly and perceptibly, as though the sounds of the new/old Soviet/Russian national anthem had signaled the dawn of a new era for everyone. Soviet instincts, it seemed, kicked in all over the country, and the Soviet Union was instantly restored in spirit.<br> &nbsp;<br> You could not quite measure the change. One brilliant Ph.D. student at Moscow University noticed that traditional ways of critiquing election practices, such as tallying up violations (these were on the increase&#x2014;things like open voting and group voting became routine) or trying to document falsifications (a nearly impossible task) fell short of measuring such a seemingly ephemeral thing<br> as culture. Darya Oreshkina introduced the term &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d;&#x2014; one in which elections, while formally free, are orchestrated by local authorities trying to curry favor with the federal center.<br> She identified their statistical symptoms, such as anomalously high voter turnouts and a strikingly high proportion of votes accrued by the leader of the race. She was able to show that over time, the<br> number of precincts where &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d; decided the outcome grew steadily, and grew fast. In other words, with every election at every level of government, Russians ceded to the authorities more of their power to decide. &#x201c;Geography disappeared,&#x201d; she said later&#x2014;meaning, the entire country was turning into an undifferentiated managed space.<br> &nbsp;<br> IN MARCH 2004, when Putin stood for reelection, he had five opponents. They had overcome extreme obstacles to join the race. A law that went into effect just before the campaigns launched required that a notary certify the presence and signature of every person present at a meeting at which a presidential candidate is nominated. Since the law required that a minimum of five hundred people attend such a meeting, the preliminaries took four to five hours; people had to arrive in the middle of the day to certify their presence so that the meeting could commence in the evening. After the meeting the potential candidate had a few weeks to collect two million signatures. The old law had required half as many signatures and allotted twice as much time to collect them; but more important, the new law specified the look of these signatures down to the comma. Hundreds<br> of thousands of signatures were thrown out by the Central Election Commission because of violations such as the use of &#x201c;St. Petersburg&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;Saint Petersburg&#x201d; or the failure to write out the words &#x201c;building&#x201d; or &#x201c;apartment&#x201d; in the address line.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of Putin&#x2019;s St. Petersburg city hall colleagues told me years later that during his tenure as Sobchak&#x2019;s deputy, Putin had received &#x201c;a powerful inoculation against the democratic process.&#x201d; He and Sobchak had ultimately fallen victim to the democratic menace in St. Petersburg, and now that Putin was running the country, he was restoring the late-Soviet mechanisms of control: he was building a tyranny of bureaucracy. The Soviet bureaucracy had been so unwieldy, incomprehensible, and forbidding that one could function within it only by engaging in corruption, using either money or personal favors as currency. That made the system infinitely pliant&#x2014;which is why &#x201c;special electoral culture&#x201d; functioned so well.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the voting itself, international observers and Russian nongovernmental organizations documented a slew of violations, including: the deletion from the rolls of over a million very elderly<br> people and other unlikely voters (when I went to cast my vote, I was able to see that my eighty-four-year-old grandmother&#x2019;s name was in fact missing from the list; my voting precinct was also, coincidentally, located next door to an office of the ruling United Russia party); the delivery of prefilled ballots to a psychiatric ward; precinct staff arriving at an elderly voter&#x2019;s home with a mobile ballot box and leaving hastily when they saw that she was planning to vote for someone other than Putin; and managers and school officials telling staff or students&#x2019; parents that contracts or financing depended on their vote. In all likelihood, none of these steps was dictated directly by the Kremlin; rather, following renewed Soviet instincts, individuals did what they could for their president.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the campaign, opposition candidates constantly encountered refusals to print their campaign material, air their commercials, or even rent them space for campaign events. Yana Dubeykovskaya,<br> who managed the campaign of nationalist-leftist economist Sergei Glazyev, told me that it took days to find a printing plant willing to accept Glazyev&#x2019;s money. When the candidate tried to hold a campaign event in Yekaterinburg, the largest city in the Urals, the police suddenly kicked everyone out of the building, claiming there was a bomb threat. In Nizhny Novgorod, Russia&#x2019;s third-largest city, electricity was turned off when Glazyev was getting ready to speak&#x2014;and every subsequent<br> campaign event in that city was held outdoors, since no one was willing to rent to the pariah candidate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Around election time, I interviewed a distant acquaintance, the thirty-one-year-old deputy director of news programming on All-Russia State Television. Eight years earlier, Yevgeniy Revenko had<br> become the youngest reporter working at a national television channel, Gusinsky&#x2019;s independent NTV. He had quickly become known as one of the more enterprising and dogged reporters. The way he worked now seemed to be very different. &#x201c;A country like Russia needs the sort of television that can effectively deliver the government&#x2019;s message,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;As the state grows stronger, it needs to convey its message directly, with no interpretations.&#x201d; He described his channel&#x2019;s editorial policy as a simple one: &#x201c;We do show negative stories&#x2014;we will report a disaster, if it occurs, for example&#x2014;but we do not go looking for them. Nor do we go looking for positive stories, but we do focus the viewers&#x2019; attention on them. We never speculate about the reasons for something&#x2014;say, an official&#x2019;s fi ring&#x2014;even if we happen to know the reason. All our information comes from official government statements. In any case, the logic is simple. We are a state television company. Our state is a presidential republic. That means we do not criticize the president.&#x201d; Very occasionally, admitted Revenko over a mug of beer at an Irish pub in the center of Moscow, he felt he had to stifle his creative urge. &#x201c;But I say to myself, &#x2018;This is where I work.&#x2019;&#x201d; He grew up in a military family and had some military training himself. That clearly helped.<br> &nbsp;<br> The late Soviet state had depended on using the many and punishing the few&#x2014;and the KGB had been in charge of the latter. This system had been more or less restored now. While the vast majority enthusiastically fell in line, those who did not paid the price. Marina Litvinovich, the young woman who had helped create Putin and had urged him to go talk to the families of the <i>Kursk </i>crew, was now managing the campaign of his lone liberal opponent in the race, former parliament member Irina Khakamada, who had herself supported Putin four years earlier. During the campaign, Litvinovich got a phone call telling her, &#x201c;We know where you live and where your child plays outside.&#x201d; She hired a bodyguard for her three-year-old. She was also robbed and beaten. Yana Dubeykovskaya, Glazyev&#x2019;s campaign manager, was also beaten and robbed, and once started driving her car before discovering that the brakes had been cut. A step down on the persecution ladder were apartment burglaries. In the months leading up to the election, opposition journalists and activists of Committee 2008&#x2014;a group organizing to bring about a more fair election in four<br> years&#x2014;had their apartments broken into. Often these burglaries occurred concurrently in different areas of Moscow. My own apartment was burglarized in February. The only things taken were a laptop computer, the hard drive from a desktop computer, and a cell phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> On election night, Khakamada planned a great defeat party. Her campaign rented a spacious Southwestern-themed restaurant and splurged on a spread of salmon, lobster, artichokes, and an open bar. Popular music groups lined up at the microphone, and the country&#x2019;s best-known rock journalist emceed. Nobody came. Waiters seemed to outnumber the guests, and the artichokes lingered. Still, the organizers continued to check all comers against a strict name list. Russian liberals were still struggling to come to terms with just how marginal they had become.<br> &nbsp;<br> Watching the guests, I was thinking it was understandable that it had taken a while. Four years after putting Putin in office, the few liberals who had switched to the opposition still had personal connections to the many former liberals who remained part of the Russian political establishment. In a vacant dining room off the main hall, Marina Litvinovich perched at one end of a long empty oak table next to Andrei Bystritsky, deputy chairman of the Russian state television and radio conglomerate. Bystritsky, a red-bearded bon vivant in his mid-forties, complained about the wine. &#x201c;The wine is no worse than our election results,&#x201d; Litvinovich shot back. Bystritsky immediately ordered a hundred-dollar bottle of wine for the table, and then another. It seemed he had come to assuage his guilt. He assured anyone who would listen that he had voted for Khakamada and had even told his two hair-and-makeup people to vote for her. Of course, he had also run the campaign coverage that went out to about forty-five million Russian homes, and told them, over and over again, to vote for Putin. Seventy-one percent of the voters did.<br> &nbsp;<br> I went to see Bystritsky in his office three days after the election. We had known each other a long time&#x2014;in the mid-1990s he had been my editor at <i>Itogi&#x2014;</i>so there was no point in pussyfooting around the main question.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So tell me,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;how do you conduct the propaganda of Putin&#x2019;s regime?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bystritsky shrugged uncomfortably and busied himself with hospitable preliminaries. He offered me tea, cookies, chocolates, chocolate-covered marshmallows, and finally a CD with the collected speeches, photographs, and video footage of President Putin. The slipcover had five photographs of the president: serious, intense, impassioned, formal smiling, and informal smiling. The serious one had been reproduced widely: on Election Day alone, I came across it on the cover of school notebooks, on preframed portraits for sale at the Moscow Central Post Offi ce (a bargain at $1.50 for a letter-size picture), and on pink, white, and blue balloons for sale in Red Square. The sale of any of these items on voting day was a violation of election law.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t especially do any propaganda,&#x201d; Bystritsky said, settling into a leather armchair. &#x201c;Look at the election, for example.&#x201d; Russian law left over from the nineties required media outlets to provide all candidates with equal access to viewers and readers. Bystritsky had his numbers ready, and it was funny math: the president, he claimed, had engaged in only one election activity&#x2014;meeting with his campaign activists&#x2014;and the twenty-nine-minute meeting was broadcast three times in its entirety during regular newscasts, which had to be extended to accommodate it. On every other day of the campaign, the state television channel also showed Putin during its newscasts&#x2014;usually as the lead story&#x2014;but these, Bystritsky explained, were not campaign activities but the stuff of the president&#x2019;s day job. An exhaustive study conducted by the Russian Union of Journalists, on the other hand, concluded that Putin got about seven times as much news coverage on the state channel as did<br> either Khakamada or the Communist Party candidate; other candidates fared even worse. Coverage by the other state channel, the one that...</p><h2>Praying by Hand: Rediscovering the Rosary As a Way of Prayer</h2><p>This book explains how the rosary as a meditative technique gradually developed with the Christian community over the course of the centuries.

Chock-full of treasures of the English language, the diversity of terms collected here covers topics from plants and animals (a parade of elephants, an embarrassment of pandas) to people and things (a pomposity of professors, an exultation of fireworks) and range from the familiar (a pride of lions) to the downright obscure (an ooze of amoebas). Pronunciations, definitions, etymologies, and historical anecdotes make this beautiful book an entertaining read, a standout reference, and a visual treat.

America is officially at war with Germany and Japan, and everyone wants to do their part. In twelve-year-old Colton&#39;s case, that means stepping up at home once his older brother, Danny, ships out with the navy. But before Danny leaves for boot camp, the brothers are fishing on the Atlantic Ocean when Danny&#39;s boat is capsized by a Nazi U-boat, nearly killing him. When more U-boats start attacking the next day, Colton realizes just how close the enemy is to American shores. With Danny&#39;s life in the balance, Colton does the only thing he can think of to help his family and his country: He steals his brother&#39;s enlisting papers and joins up instead. Colton&#39;s bold decision leads to a deadly journey. Even if he can keep his age a secret and survive boot camp, he&#39;ll have to face Hitler&#39;s ruthless submarines. But the longer he&#39;s on the seas, the less sure sure Colton is that he and his shipmates can stop such a relentless enemy . . .</p><p></p><h2>Hearing from Wayne and Other Stories</h2><p>NY 1988 1st (stated) Knopf. 127pp., hardcover. Fine in Fine DJ.</p><p>Franzen's highly entertaining debut is a collection of short short stories, most of which are reprinted from such journals as the New Yorker, Gentlemen's Quarterly and the National Lampoon. The 18 pieces are carefully crafted studies in whimsy and moments of truth, and all of them prompt a smile. Almost invariably, the characters are waiting for the "right moment" or the "right person" and as a result have put their lives on hold. The casual first-person style is deceptive, because few writers capture with such grace and precision the sloppiness of folksy speech and mannerisms. In the title story, the narrator receives a postcard from his best friend, written from beyond the grave; "After I Won the Lottery" concerns a man who has trouble giving away his money; "37 Years" is about a man whose doctor tells him he has only that exact number of years left to live and who brags about the heightened reality of his existence as a result. He vows to "enjoy life, maybe drive to the bank, maybe take the long way." "Mom and Pop Biz" recounts every writer's nightmare: Mom and Pop start a magazine, ask Sonny for an article, then reject it, several times. Perhaps the funniest and most biting is "Come Stay with Us," a collection of travel brochures for affordable vacations with the desperate farm families of "beautiful Luling peninsula," one of which gushes: "Don't be too surprised if the eldest ones in our brood want to entertain you on their motorized bikes." <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Brigadista Year</h2><p><b>In an engrossing historical novel, the Newbery Medal-winning author of <i>Bridge to Terabithia</i> follows a young Cuban teenager as she volunteers for Fidel Castro&#x2019;s national literacy campaign and travels into the impoverished countryside to teach others how to read.</b><br><br>When thirteen-year-old Lora tells her parents that she wants to join Premier Castro&#x2019;s army of young literacy teachers, her mother screeches to high heaven, and her father roars like a lion.

But Nora is stubborn: didn&#x2019;t her parents teach her to share what she has with someone in need? Surprisingly, Nora&#x2019;s abuela takes her side, even as she makes Nora promise to come home if things get too hard. But how will Nora know for sure when that time has come? Shining light on a little-known moment in history, Katherine Paterson traces a young teen&#x2019;s coming-of-age journey from a sheltered life to a singular mission: teaching fellow Cubans of all ages to read and write, while helping with the work of their daily lives and sharing the dangers posed by counterrevolutionaries hiding in the hills nearby.

The &#39;war for talent&#39; is one battle every company believes it should be waging. But while competitors are busy chasing after the same &#39;hot&#39; individuals, smart companies are doing something infinitely more useful and far more difficult to copy - they&#39;re building organizations that make it possible for ordinary people at every desk and cubicle in their companies to perform as if they were stars. Blowing up the prevailing wisdom that companies must chase and acquire top talent in order to remain successful, &#34;Hidden Value&#34; argues instead that the source of sustained competitive advantage already exists within every organization. O&#39;Reilly and Pfeffer, leading experts on organizational behavior and human resources, argue that how a firm creates and uses talent is far more important than how the firm attracts talent. The authors provide vivid, detailed case studies of several organizations in widely disparate industries - including Southwest Airlines, Cisco Systems, The Men&#39;s Wearhouse, and NUMMI - to illustrate how long-term success comes from value-driven, interrelated systems that align good people management with corporate strategy. In a refreshing break from management tomes that force-feed superficial frameworks and trite &#39;rules&#39;, the authors instead allow the company stories to take center stage. They guide readers in discovering for themselves how seven different firms maximize talent, why one firm hasn&#39;t fully released the hidden value in its work force, and, most importantly, how the winning companies have made it tough for competitors to imitate them. Collectively, the stories reveal a common path to success that places values before strategy, emphasizes implementation over planning, and focuses on getting the best out of all employees, not just individual stars. The authors also explore concerns or questions managers might have about how each company&#39;s experience parallels or conflicts with their own. Providing a rare opportunity for managers to actively participate in an invaluable learning process, &#34;Hidden Value&#34; offers a customizable template for building high-performance, people-centered organizations.</p><p>Charles A. O&#39;Reilly III is the Frank E. Buck Professor of Human Resources Management and Organizational Behavior and Director of the Human Resource Executive Program and Managing Technology and Strategic Innovation Executive Program at Stanford University.In today's heated job market, companies must look within to develop and nurture talented employees, say O'Reilly and Pfeffer, both professors at Stanford Business School. They offer a detailed look at several companiesAamong them, Cisco, Men's Warehouse and PSS World MedicalAthat are profitable in competitive industries and that have successfully retained and promoted their staffs. Following a brief company history, the authors present a straightforward discussion of each company's culture and policies, in some cases including quotations from its executives. Occasionally, the secrets of a company's success are obvious: Southwest Airlines has carefully chosen a niche market; it puts high value on customer service and its employees feel as if their daily work will contribute to the future of the company. Certainly, CEO Herb Kelleher is part of the winning formula, but Southwest's business is run differently than other airlines. Its employees can work at different jobs and financial data about the company's performance as well as its competitors is shared regularly with staffers. Similarly, PSS Medical values its employees and works very hard at both recruiting and training people who will fit in at the company. With its emphasis on detailed anecdotes, this unusually engaging management book proves that concentrating on "soft issues" like employee values can give a company the competitive edge.

She and her husband divide their time between Massachussetts and Scotland.&nbsp;<strong></strong>&nbsp;Grade 3 Up-- Yolen dates Tam Lin's ballad back to 1549; later on, Robert Burns wrote what is perhaps the most familiar version. The most frequently anthologized prose version is Joseph Jacobs's "Tamlane," which originally appeared in More English Fairy Tales . Related to "Wild Robin," this is a tale of the faery queen's favorite, grown to manhood and due to be ritually sacrificed. Jennet saves him by holding fast as he changes into a lion, a snake, and a flame that she throws into a well and sprinkles with holy water, breaking the spell. Yolen's story is, as always, lyrical and true to the spirit of the tale and time. Mikolaycak's large-format double-page spreads of vibrant watercolor and colored pencil on Diazo prints soar across pages and break out of slender, peaceful borders. The red and green of rose bushes dominate; the tartans are original designs--"After all, a faery tale demands its own colors and plaids," Yolen states in background notes. She omits Jennet's pregnancy and other adult aspects of the tale. More satisfying in both art and telling than Betsy James's simpler version, The Red Cloak (Chronicle, 1989), and for an older audience than Susan Jeffers's Wild Robin (Dutton, 1976), this is a wildly romantic addition to any folklore collection. --Helen Gregory, Grosse Pointe Pub .

Violence. Scandal. These are words we rarely associate with the sacred text of the Bible. Yet in this brilliant new book, Jonathan Kirsch shows that the Old Testament is filled with some of the most startling and explicit stories in all of Western literature. These tales of seduction and rape, voyeurism and exhibitionism, intermarriage and illegitimacy, assassination and murder have been suppressed by religious authorities throughout history precisely because they are so shocking. "You mean that's in the Bible?" is the common reaction of the contemporary reader to the stories that Kirsch retells and explores.<br><br>In The Harlot by the Side of the Road, Kirsch recounts these suppressed and mistranslated tales in the grand storytelling tradition. Here is the tale of Dinah, the young Israelite daughter raped by a princely suitor. The price for her hand in marriage? The circumcision of every man in his kingdom. Here, too, is the story of Lot's daughters, who, when faced with the possibility that they are the last survivors on earth, must copulate with their drunken father to continue their race. And the story of Tamar, the harlot by the side of the road, who must disguise herself as a prostitute and seduce her father-in-law in order to bear the child who has been promised her. <br><br>Kirsch places each story within the political and social context of its time, and delves into the latest biblical scholarship to explain why each story was originally censored. He also brings to light when and where each story was first written down, and how it found its way into the Bible. And he shows how these stories have something important to say to contemporary readers who might never pick up a Bible.<br><br>Kirsch reveals that the Bible's real power lies in its unflinching lessons in human nature. And he illuminates the surprising modernity of the Bible's characters: these were, like us, people delicately balanced between their destructive and generous natures. Certain to excite controversy and ignite intellectual debate, The Harlot by the Side of the Road will undoubtedly be one of the year's most talked-about books.</p><p>Sometimes when you work for a big book company, there are so many books that you aren't completely aware of every one your coworkers are publishing. I read about Harlot in Publisher's weekly, and was so intrigued that I made a mental note to pick up a copy when it came out. A month later, I had completely forgotten that it was a Ballantine book and while pursing the stacks in a local bookstore, came across it and was still intrigued. Without looking at the imprint on the spine (that little logo that tells you who published the book) I bought it and started reading it on the subway. Fascinating!

Indeed, as James E. Davis shows, many newcomers found Illinois a hospitable and relatively peaceful place in which to start a new life. In this sweeping history of the making of the state, Davis tells the story of Illinois from the Ice Age to the eve of the Civil War. He describes the earliest Native American civilizations, the coming of LaSalle and Joliet and the founding of the French colony, the brief history of British Illinois, and the complex history of subsequent settlement that brought distinct cultural traditions to Illinois.<p>A major theme of this book is the relative absence of violence, at least after the Blackhawk War of 1832, even over explosive issues such as slavery. Davis treats these developments in careful detail, while keeping the reader mindful of the experiences of Illinois' ordinary people.</p></p><p>A Choice Outstanding Academic BookJames E.

But two hundred years earlier, the Balkans did not exist. It was not the Balkans but the &#39;Rumeli&#39; that the Ottomans ruled, the formerly Roman lands they had conquered from Byzantium, together with their Christian inhabitants. In</p><p>Throughout history, the Balkans have been a crossroads, a zone of endless military, cultural, and economic mixing and clashing between Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy. In this highly acclaimed short history, Mark Mazower sheds light on what has been called the tinderbox of Europe, whose troubles have ignited wider wars for hundreds of years. Focusing on events from the emergence of the nation-state onward, &#34;The Balkans reveals with piercing clarity the historical roots of current conflicts and gives a landmark reassessment of the region&#39;s history, from the world wars and the Cold War to the collapse of communism, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the continuing search for stability in southeastern Europe.&#x201c;A gem of a book, packed with illuminating information.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;An invaluable resource for anyone hoping to gain an initial understanding of Balkan history.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;An excellent primer on the region&#x2019;s history.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Economist </i><br><br>&#x201c;A highly suggestive analysis of an inexhaustible subject.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Words and Pictures</h2><p>A fascinating insight into the work of the Children&#39;s Laureate in his own words and pictures.</p><p></p><h2>10,000 Years of Art</h2><p>Chronologically presents five hundred examples of art from different countries, cultures, and civilizations and discusses what makes each piece both unique and representative.</p><p>Contributors include some 35 museum curators, academics and archaeologists from the UK, Europe and the US, all of them specialists in their fields of art history.

What Time is It? Notes From the Peanut Gallery</h2><p>Say Kids! What Time Is It? is the first backstage history of The Howdy Doody Show, which transfixed children of the American Baby Boom between 1947 and 1960. Author Stephen Davis, the son of Howdy writer and director Howard Davis, provides an authoritative look at the glamorous early days of television in New York and the improbable cast that populated Doodyville - Buffalo Bob, Princess Summerfall Winterspring, Clarabell, and Chief Thunderthud - whose daily on-camera adventures are indelibly branded on the consciousness of a generation. Davis also tells the real life stories of Bob Smith, Robert Keesan, Judy Tyler, Dayton Allen, and the other bright new faces of the 1950s who made Howdy Doody the first hit show on network television. Say Kids! What Time Is It? chronicles all of Howdy&#39;s dramatic crises: the 1952 cast rebellion, the firing of the first Clarabell, Buffalo bob&#39;s near-fatal heart attack, the desertion of the beautiful Princess to star with Elvis Presley in Jailhouse Rock, and the final crushing ratings defeat by the Mouse from California. Say Kids! What Time Is It? is an irresistible and sometimes shocking trip behind the scenes of collective memory for Howdy fans everywhere.</p><p>The documentation of popular TV programs from the 1950s and '60s has become something of a growth area in publishing, with monographs on shows as diverse as The Honeymooners and The Outer Limits . Say Kids! is an insider's account of another such program, The Howdy Doody Show , which the author's father directed between 1952 and 1956. (The author appeared as part of the Peanut Gallery during those years.) Liberally illustrated, the book is a funny, well-written portrait of that era's live television and of a type of children's programming seldom seen today. Recommended for all media collections. A.J.

Although not every reader will personally relate to the opening presumption of Chris Raschka's <i>Arlene Sardine</i>, all will appreciate his lively approach to the humble story of an unsung heroine. Arlene starts out as a little fish who knows exactly what color her parachute is--the slippery gray-green of a sardine. Her career takes off when she and a few of her "ten hundred thousand friends" are caught in a purse net and thrown onto the deck of a fishing boat. After taking her last gilled gasp, Arlene is sorted, salted, smoked, packed in oil, <i>et voil�</i>, her dream has come true!<p> While some adults may read this tale as either a morbid take on the traditional fish story or a thinly veiled call to vegetarianism, it is intended to be neither. Grownups occasionally need reminding that for children, the concept of death is not nearly so fraught with fear and panic and heartache as it is for adults. Arlene isn't much bothered by it either. She knows that sardines are, by definition, dead fish--she simply marks her target and shoots for it.</p><p> Raschka earned a Caldecott Honor for <i>Yo! Yes?</i>, and his <i>Mysterious Thelonious</i> garnered acclaim as the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Best Illustrated Book of 1997. In <i>Arlene Sardine</i>, he uses exuberant pastel watercolors and bold, abstract strokes to bring the undersea world alive (and keep it kicking even after the sea life is dead). His text is typically minimal and musical: "Then she was smoked, delicately. She was delicately smoked. Delicately smoked was she." Children will enjoy this matter-of-fact yet playful telling of one tiny fish's journey to sardinehood (and in the process discover words like <i>fjord</i>, <i>thronging</i>, and <i>hermetically</i>), and parents may also learn a thing or two by loosening up and swimming along for the ride. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>Focus: Something Smells Fishy Here<p>The Books for Youth staff, along with two contributing reviewers, were looking at recent arrivals when the new Chris Raschka book caught our attention. As the book was passed from one to another, each of our reactions was exactly the same--this has got to be some sort of a bad joke, right?</p><p>The book in question is <i>Arlene Sardine</i>. It follows the life--and death--of a sardine. Named Arlene. It begins, "So you want to be a sardine." Although this is a concept that probably has not occurred to young children, they will be even less likely to want to be one after they are introduced to this book.</p><p>Although Arlene begins her life as a brisling in a fjord with 10,000 friends, when she is two, she is "grown-up enough to become a sardine." This is not a good career move for Arlene, since it involves being caught in a net ("a big net, a purse net, a big purse net"), left without food and water for three days, and emptied out on the deck of the boat--dying.</p><p>That's the bad news for Arlene. The good news is that she is put on ice with her friends and shipped off to the factory. One might assume that once the story's heroine is dead, there would be a lull in the action, but no. Arlene must be graded by size, bathed in brine, and then smoked: "Then she was smoked, delicately. She was delicately smoked. Delicately smoked was she."</p><p>Raschka opines that Arlene feels "well-rested on the conveyer belt." He has no opinion about her frame of mind as she was packed in her can, but he does wonder if she was nervous before her final inspection. Since the illustrations depict a canned dead fish, this seems unlikely. As, perhaps, a celebratory statement about the circle of life, the final pages proclaim: "Arlene was a sardine. A sardine is what Arlene was."</p><p>The best part of the book is its design and illustrations. Blocks and splashes of color against foam-white pages make an almost jaunty background for the action. Still, though a page or two of sardines might elicit a certain curiosity among readers, after 40 pages, sardines tend to look the same. Especially the dead ones.</p><p>The negative reaction of the <i>Booklist</i> staff was so immediate and sharp for several reasons. Subject matter, yes, but then there are all sorts of books written on arcane subjects. Sometimes they work. But Arlene's life cycle, the high point of which is dying and being stuffed into a can, seems a dubious topic upon which to write a book for preschoolers. Older children, who, one might desperately argue, have a more inherent interest in sardines, would find the book's design babyish. One suspects the natural audience for this is adults, who may want to buy it as a campy gift.</p><p>The other thing that is so offensive about the book is that it smacks of the emperor's-new-clothes syndrome. Could anyone besides a well-respected author/illustrator get away with getting something like this published? Suppose a novice writer sends in a book over the transom. It's called <i>Arlene Sardine</i>. It contains such lines as, "Arlene was covered in oil, olive oil, closed up with no air inside, hermetically, and cooked in her can." A book like this from a no-name author would be returned faster than you could down a sardine. And rightfully so.</p><p>Not every book by every author (even well-respected ones) can be a success. And, certainly, to advance children's literature, chances need to be taken by writers, illustrators, and publishers. But this seems to us to be not an effort to try something new and different but an attempt to can something, slap the Chris Raschka label on it, and hope it sells. We're here to say, "Buyer Beware." <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p></p><h2>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America</h2><p><p>Now, Jack R. Gannon&#x2019;s original groundbreaking volume on Deaf history and culture is available once again. In <i>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America</i>, Gannon brought together for the first time the story of the Deaf experience in America from a Deaf perspective. Recognizing the need to document the multifaceted history of this unique minority with its distinctive visual culture, he painstakingly gathered as much material as he could on Deaf American life. The result is a 17-chapter montage of artifacts and information that forms an utterly fascinating record from the early nineteenth century to the time of its original publication in 1981.</p><p><i>Deaf Heritage</i> tracks the development of the Deaf community both chronologically and by significant subjects. The initial chapter treats the critical topics of early attempts at deaf education, the impact of Deaf and Black deaf teachers, the establishment of schools for the deaf, and the founding of Gallaudet College. Individual chapters cover the 1880s through the 1970s, mixing milestones such as the birth of the National Association of the Deaf and the work of important figures, Deaf and hearing, with anecdotes about day-to-day deaf life. Other chapters single out important facets of Deaf culture: American Sign Language, Deaf Sports, Deaf artists, Deaf humor, and Deaf publications. The overall effect of this remarkable record, replete with archival photographs, tables, and lists of Deaf people&#x2019;s accomplishments, reveals the growth of a vibrant legacy singular in American history.</p></p><p><p><b>Jack R.

Modeled after her grandmother, Euna Mae, Amy's big-hearted lifestyle has become noticed by a disconnected world that is drawn to her mission of using food to love, welcome, and serve those around her. Amy encourages people to open their homes and their hearts, connecting with folks over food; and she offers home cooks simple, crowd-pleasing, comfort recipes, meals that can be prepared for whatever the hospitality affair. Recipes like Brown Sugar Chili over Cheese Grits, Cream Cheese Chicken Enchiladas, and Sam's Pulled Pork are perfect belly-fillers for gathering people in your home. And recipes like Comfort Chicken Pot Pie, Hello Dolly Brownies, and Layered Spaghetti Pie are ideal for giving to folks when they just need to feel loved. Combined with her refreshing enthusiasm and approachable recipes, Amy Hannon has ignited a passion in young cooks who are spreading their hospitality wings, and she has reignited that same passion in seasoned cooks who had forgotten how much joy comes from serving others. Love Welcome Serve, Amy's first cookbook, will encourage you to embrace hospitality so you can enjoy the life that happens when you make and serve food for your people.</p><p>A reputation of hospitality and service paved the way for Amy Nelson Hannon to burst onto the scene in the fall of 2013. Amy gathered goods and treasures to create Euna Mae&#39;s Heirloom Kitchen Boutique booth at a regional holiday shopping event. People responded overwhelmingly not only to her products but also to her warmth. She sold out of every item in less than two days and had a list of people who wanted to be contacted for more. Not only did Amy find a market for her carefully curated products, but she discovered there was a growing demand for them. From her store to her online presence, that message has ignited a passion in young cooks who are just learning how to be hospitable and has reignited the same passion in seasoned cooks who had forgotten how much joy comes from serving others. In a marketplace that swings from fancy and foraged to homegrown, Amy has settled on a perfect blend of family, friends and food. Her message that welcoming others into your home can be reasonable and lovely offers a refreshing voice in a conversation filled with complicated recipes, expensive ingredients and quite frankly a whole lot of work. For Amy it always goes back to the heart-a heart to love, welcome and serve.</p><h2>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading): and Selections from A Treatise of Human Nature</h2><p>Presents the thesis of a thinker who was a scientist, psychologist, metaphysician, and skeptic.

He has carved it himself?from ?turquoise as blue as a dragonfly&#x2019;s wing, and carnelian, as red as the inside of a pomegranate.&#x201d; Muti wears it every day as she grows from a small child into an independent young woman.<br><br>When at the age of thirteen she is sent to work for King Snefru, the mighty Pharaoh of Egypt, Muti finds out just how precious her necklace really is. And in the process, she learns the value of standing up for what she treasures most.<br><br>With Louise Hawes&#x2019;s clear, evocative prose and Rebecca Guay&#x2019;s rich, powerful illustrations, Muti&#x2019;s tale from thousands of years ago burns brightly alive today.</p><p>Louise Hawes is the author of many novels for young adults and is also a faculty member of the Spalding University MFA in Writing program. She has always loved fairy tales and says that Black Pearls was written for &#39;everyone who dances without looking at the clock.&#39; She lives in North Carolina.Grade 1-4&#x2013;Adapting and expanding an ancient Egyptian story, Hawes has created an original fairy tale about familial love and its power to thwart even the majesty of Pharaoh. Muti cherishes the necklace her father made for her when she was born, associating it with many happy memories. After turning 13, she leaves her beloved family to work as a servant in King Snefru's palace. Pharaoh, impressed by her beauty and grace, makes her the leader of a cohort of female rowers for his pleasure boat. When her necklace breaks and falls into the lake, she refuses to row or to accept a replacement. It is so important to her that she stands up to Pharaoh, who is now even more impressed by her determination. Where the story contrasts sharply with traditional fairy tales is in the climax: when Snefru asks Muti to become his queen, she declines, preferring to be reunited with her family. The writing style favors the more fleshed-out manner of a short story than the leanness of a folktale. Guay's lush watercolor-and-gouache paintings incorporate elements of Egyptian art and culture, including jewelry motifs, decorative geometric patterns in the scenery, and headdresses and hairstyles. The characters' faces and gestures are expressive and dramatic, and the surrounding landscape teems with life.<i>&#x2013;Coop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Standing in the middle of this confluence, I can't help but feel the possibility of the universe unfolding a little, <i>once upon a time</i>," he writes in the opening chapter of this slim, luminous volume. Buzbee manages just the right mix of history lesson and personal recollection. He reflects upon the roots of the book trade (the first great library at Alexandria, where the vast holdings were each hand copied by scribes onto papyrus scrolls); the progression of retail (from simple market stalls to book hawkers to the megastores of today); and his own hours lovingly logged at the literary chain store, Upstart Crow, where, as an eager teenager in San Jose, California, he learned the ins and outs of the business. Bookstores, Buzbee reminds us, are not just places of intellectual indulgence; they're historically significant, too. The celebrated Paris establishment, Shakespeare &amp; Co., was the first to publish James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights gave voice to Allen Ginsberg's <i>Howl</i>. Both anecdotal and eloquent, <i>The Yellow-Lighted Bookshop</i> is a tribute to those who crave the cozy confines of a bookshop, a place to be "alone among others" and savor a bountiful literary buffet. <i>Allison Block</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low.Kindergarten-Grade 4-Though Freeman died in 1978, his love for storytelling and, in particular, his love for music live on through this previously unpublished tale of determination personified in the character of a praying mantis. The lonely insect longs to join other creatures in making music, but lacks the chirp of the crickets or the croak of the frogs. He also fails at building his own instruments, as a reed made into a flute makes no noise, the flower of a trumpet vine does not blow, and his "snippy" claws break the strings of a twig-and-cobweb harp. Finally, an intelligent and observant spider agrees to help him, if he promises not to eat her for dinner. An artistic collaboration is born as Debby Webster spins web and other objects into an instrument that will bring music into Manuelo's life. The rich pastel illustrations present the world of the resolute Manuelo as the "playing mantis" introduces various instruments to readers. With his stick-thin limbs, the insect makes a graceful figure as he plays his homemade cello. The tiny white spider perfectly reflects the delicate nature of the web she spins. With characters that are empathetic and intrepid, this story makes a good model for encouraging youngsters to persevere when they encounter difficulties. A fine choice for all libraries, this book will be of special interest to young musicians.<i>-Mary Elam, Forman Elementary School, Plano, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This edition includes eight pages of new material.<br><br>Long respected as one of the finest and most original of today's underground comics artists, Gloeckner shows both technical artistry and tremendous range&#x2014;from her sly, lurid, and brilliantly colored posters for rock groups to her textbook-quality medical illustrations; from her sharp naturalistic juxtapositions for <i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i> (J.G. Ballard) to the signature comics for which she is best known.<br><br>Pages include both black and white and color comics, some that were published before in obscure comic books, and some of her classics in addition to new stories. In detailed, nuanced panels, these strips depict the isolation, horror, and disappointment&#x2014;but also the revolutionary, transformative power&#x2014;of young women trapped in circumstances ringed with drugs and sexual abuse. Gloeckner continues as a major literary and visual artist.</p><p>Phoebe Gloeckner was born in Philadelphia and raised in San Francisco. Her comics first appeared in underground publications when she was in her teens. Gloeckner is also author/illustrator of the critically acclaimed <i>Diary of a Teenage Girl</i>, published by North Atlantic Books in 2003. In addition to paintings and comics, she has made award-winning short films.Gloeckner is a legendary figure in underground comics. Her short, powerfully candid and visually explicit autobiographical graphic narratives vividly re-create the sexual victimization of her childhood and adolescence. Her first full-length book combines new work in color and in black-and-white, including the title story, along with older, shorter narrative comics dating back to 1976. (An appendix reprints her disturbing medical illustrations for J.G. Ballard's avant-SF classic The Atrocity Exhibition.) Abandoned by her father and sexually victimized by her alcoholic mother's lovers, the teenage heroine of "Minnie's 3rd Love" endures a "week-long nightmare of sex and drug-taking" among the hustlers and addicts of 1974 San Francisco. In the ruefully humorous "Quaker School Q-Ties," girls team up to embarrass, and disgust, boys in their grade school. Gloeckner's drawings combine a labored precision with a wild, often satirical expressiveness; her protagonists can resemble sad, angry toy dolls. Undergound comics master R. Crumb's introduction combines glowing praise and a typically embarrassing confession: "I, too, lusted after the young, budding artist-cartoonist." <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sixty Feet, Six Inches: A Hall of Fame Pitcher &amp; a Hall of Fame Hitter Talk About How the Game Is Played</h2><p><b>Reggie Jackson and Bob Gibson offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to understand America's pastime from their unique insider perspective.</b><br><br>Legendary.

Everybody else was there for my convenience. The pitcher was there to throw me a ball to hit. The catcher was there to throw it back to him if he didn't give me what I wanted the first time. And the umpire was lucky that he was close enough to watch. Gibson was the same way. That's why people thought he was mean. And that's the attitude you've got to have. When I hit, I felt I was in control of the home-plate area, and it was important that I felt that way. If I let the pitcher control it, it would give him an advantage. There are at least three kinds of advantages that the pitcher and batter contest. There's the physical advantage, the strategic advantage, and also the psychological advantage. I didn' t want two out of three. I wanted them all. The pitcher has the ball, and nothing happens until he lets go of it. So, as the batter, I felt I had to fight for any bit of control I could get. I expected the umpire, the catcher, and the pitcher to wait on me. I wanted to get ready on my time. I'd call time or pause or do something that wasn't too annoying but at least would get the pitcher off his pace. If I could disrupt his rhythm a little bit, just for a second or two, the advantage swung to me. But I didn't want to create an ire, some kind of anger to make him bear down harder. I didn't want a guy to step back and grit his teeth. Being a jerk about it just doesn't work. There's a fine line between annoying somebody just a little bit and angering him to the point where you may get drilled in the back." <br><br>Bob Gibson: "Him backing out of there all the time, that is annoying, because I liked to pitch in a hurry. But I never let it annoy me to the point that it distracted me. You don' t knock guys down for that kind of stuff. They give you plenty of other reasons to knock them down." <br><br>Reggie Jackson: "Against the great pitchers, in particular, I' d try to break that rhythm. They're going to try to pitch a fast game, under two hours if possible&#x2014;although that hardly ever happens anymore. They want to get a flow going, throw strikes, get ahead, keep you off balance and on the defensive. They want you to get in the batter's box, because they're ready to pitch. If a pitcher stays in his groove, he's going to be comfortable. He's going to be on his game plan. So you have to get him out of that comfort zone any way you can. If I could do a little something to break that rhythm&#x2014;make him say to the umpire, "Come on, get him in there, let's go, let's go!"&#x2014;I might get a ball one. You want him thinking about something other than where he's putting this first pitch. So you might step out, adjust your helmet, tie your shoe or something; but you want to be careful. You don' t want to get hit. <br><br>Bob Gibson: "I got a chuckle out of the comment that a pitcher wants to keep the game under two hours. After I'd get through warming up in the bullpen and was sitting waiting to go out there, I'd always say to the guys, 'Okay, an hour and fifty-seven minutes, let's go!" They play better behind you if you're working quickly.' " <br><br>Reggie Jackson: "Ken Holtzman could pitch a game in ninety minutes. Wouldn't throw a breaking ball. And he had a great breaking ball. <br><br>Bob Gibson: "I did that once. Went a whole game without throwing a breaking ball&#x2014;or threw two or three at the most. Got beat 2&#x2013;1."<br><br>Reggie Jackson: "It's not just stepping out of the box or slowing things down. It's any little edge you can get. When I went to home plate in a game-tied situation or with a chance to do something and help the ballclub win one, I'd try to make eye contact with the pitcher. Now, you didn't do that with Hoot&#x2014;that's what a lot of us like to call Gibson, after the old Hollywood cowboy&#x2014;or a Mickey Lolich or a Jim Palmer or a Catfish Hunter. You weren't going to stare down those guys. But if a guy was a young player, I would wait to get into the box because I wanted him to look at me. If he wouldn't look at me, I felt I had him beat. If a guy did make eye contact, you could find out if you could intimidate him. Later in my career, when I had the weight of a reputation behind me, I did that a lot." <br><br>Bob Gibson: "Heck, I couldn't see if a guy was looking at me or not. I had enough trouble trying to see the signs back there. Tell you what I did, though. I used to look in and shake off signs just to mess with the hitters. Did that all the time. Tim McCarver would give me a sign and then give me another one that meant shake me off. The thing was, I ?didn't have that many pitches to shake off to. So I'm out there shaking my head, and the batter's thinking, "What the hell?" <br><br>Reggie Jackson: "When I was with the Yankees in 1978, we were playing Baltimore at Yankee Stadium and the score was 3&#x2013;3 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. I led off against Tippy Martinez&#x2014;a little left-hander who always gave me trouble&#x2014;and the count went to three-and-oh. I had the green light in that situation, but instead of digging into the box I stepped out and looked down to the third-base coach for a sign. Then I glared over there like I was ticked off and shot a look into the dugout at our manager, Dick Howser, pretending that I was angry about getting a take sign. After all that, I stepped into the box, the pitch came floating right down the middle, and I hit a game-winning home run. In fact, that was the only home run I ever hit against Tippy Martinez. <br><br>Bob Gibson: "I got a lot of mileage out of looking angry. Sometimes it wasn't intentional&#x2014;like when I was squinting in for the signs and the batters thought I was glowering at them&#x2014;but the fact is, I was deliberately unfriendly to the opposition. I wouldn't even say hello to hitters on the other teams. I didn' t want them knowing me. I didn't want them knowing what I was like or what I was thinking. It was important to me that I retain an air of mystery. I never let the coaches put any kind of clock or gun on my pitches, because I didn't want that information to get out. I wouldn't talk to the team psychologist, because I didn't want anybody figuring me out. I even asked our manager, Red Schoendienst, to keep me out of spring training games against National League teams, if at all possible. In spring training, you're just working on stuff, not trying to get batters out all the time, and I thought that if they got up there and whacked me around a little bit it would only give them confidence. I didn't want them confident. I wanted them wary of me. Uncertain. Intimidated. The Pirates had a young outfielder named Gene Clines who came up to me before a game with a baseball and asked me to sign it. I took the ball and tossed it over my shoulder into left field. War Games"<br><br>Reggie Jackson: "Everybody in the league knew I had trouble with the inside pitch. I got away with it only because the great majority of pitchers were afraid of making a mistake in that spot. The threat of power is one of the best weapons you have in the batter's box. They were also concerned that if they missed inside, they'd hit me, put me on base. Now, for a guy like Gibson, that was okay. His attitude was, if I'm gonna miss, I'm gonna miss at you."<br><br>Bob Gibson: "What pitchers are really afraid of is their own control. They don't truly believe that they can get a pitch in there exactly where they want it&#x2014;especially against a hitter as powerful as Reggie, who can put his team on the board at any moment. They know that if they miss in the wrong place, a power hitter will knock the crap out of it. But you can't go out there with the attitude that you're going to miss your spot. You can't go out there afraid of the hitter or afraid of yourself. You've got to respect the hitter, though&#x2014;some more than others, of course&#x2014;and you' ve got to respect yourself. Contrary to what people thought, I didn't make my living on the inside corner. My idea was to pitch away, pitch away, pitch away, come in, pitch away. I mostly worked the outside part of the plate; but you can't be scared to come in when the time or the hitter calls for it. The thing is, if I'm pitching a guy inside, I'm going to make sure I get it way in there. If you put the ball in the strike zone inside&#x2014;especially against a guy who can hit the ball out of the ballpark&#x2014;that' s horrible. Left-handed or right-handed batter, it doesn't matter. Don't do that."</p><h2>A Gathering of Lace</h2><p>Collected from knitting designers all over the world, the patterns in this guide will be a joy to create for any knitter.

She never forgot that advice. When Mindy isn't "traveling" through writing books, she works as the manager of a large law firm's library.&nbsp; In her spare time, Mindy quilts, cooks and tries to tame the endless to-be-read shelf in her home library.Once upon a time, I thought that being a witch would make everything easier.<p>Yeah, right.</p><p>There I was on another Friday evening, leaning against the counter in Cake Walk, the Georgetown bakery owned by my best friend, Melissa White. Over the summer, I'd started helping Melissa close up every Friday night, after I left my job at the Peabridge Library. My assistance gave us a chance to catch up on our weeks, and then we conducted always-needed mojito therapy.</p><p>I was just waiting until we could turn the sign on the door from Walk On In to Walk On By. I could already taste icy lime juice and rum, mixed with mint and nearly frozen seltzer water in a chilled tumbler. Summer in Washington was always hot, and this late August day was no exception.</p><p>I held a glass of iced tea against the pulse point in my right wrist and tried to forgive the bakery's air-conditioning.</p><p>After all, it was doing its best to beat back the swampy heat. My red-shot curls frizzed against the back of my neck, and I was pretty sure that my kohl liner had smeared around my eyes. So much for drawing out the emerald glints trapped inside my hazel irises. Anyway, did that stuff ever work outside of fashion magazines?</p><p>I probably should have taken a page from Melissa's book and ignored makeup altogether&#x2014;after all, it was just the two of us girlfriends. The two of us, and a pitcher of icy mojitos.</p><p>Since therapy had not yet commenced, however, I took a deep swallow of mango-lime iced tea and tried to explain to Melissa. Again. "I know that it shouldn't matter. I dated Scott for twelve years&#x2014;twelve years! And I only saw the I.B. for twelve weeks."</p><p>I.B. That used to stand for Imaginary Boyfriend. Now, it stood for Idiot Bastard. Or Ignorant Boor. Or Irritating Boil. Get us going, Melissa and me, and we could continue the game for hours.</p><p>The I.B. The man I'd set my heart on. My friends and family had all agreed to refrain from using his name. He didn't deserve a name.</p><p>I sighed. "It's been ten months. Ten months, and nothing. Not a glimmer of a hint of a scintilla of a possibility on the romantic horizon. I'm never going to date again."</p><p>"Jane Madison, never is a very long time," Melissa said.</p><p>"I don't think that I can seriously take romance advice from a woman with fifty-two first dates under her belt in the past year."</p><p>"Don't exaggerate," Melissa said with a good-natured shrug. "There were only forty-one."</p><p>I shuddered. Forty-one. Forty-one nights of sitting at a table for two. Forty-one nights of coming up with witty and compelling Conversation Topics, five per date. (Okay, I knew that Melissa reused many of them, but still!) Forty-one nights of putting on perfect dating clothes, of combing out perfect dating hair, of squelching down perfect dating jitters.</p><p>And what did she have to show for it? A Friday evening with me. Me, a DVD of Casablanca,and microwave popcorn.</p><p>As if she'd read my mind, Melissa brushed her palms together, a businesswoman ever in charge. "We'd better turn on the air conditioner upstairs, or it will be hot enough to make the popcorn without getting anywhere near the microwave."</p><p>Melissa lived in a comfortable apartment above her bakery. Her little home was perfect in every way&#x2014;except it didn't have central air. In fact, it had a wheezing window unit that was probably Carrier's prototype. You know. Willis Haviland Carrier, the inventor of the air conditioner. I said Iwasalibrarian. We accumulate a ridiculous amount of trivia.</p><p>Actually, Melissa's contraption could get the job done, if we gave it enough time. The only problem was braving the oven of an apartment long enough to turn the rattling thing on. She waited for me to volunteer to step into the swamp that was her living room, but I merely shifted my wrist against my icy glass.</p><p>"Come on," she finally said. "Rock, paper, scissors." Melissa and I settled all our disputes with the childhood game. We might be immature, but we'd never had a serious fight, not in the twenty-five years that we'd been best friends. Now, we counted to three, tapping our right fists against our left palms, and then we displayed our choices&#x2014; paper for me, rock for Melissa.</p><p>"Paper covers rock," I said, trying not to gloat.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," she said good-naturedly. She turned to the steps in the back corner of the bakery. "Keep an eye on things while I'm upstairs. And don't do anything I wouldn't do."</p><p>Well, that just opened up a huge realm of possibilities, didn't it?</p><p>I turned to the gigantic stainless steel sink at the back of the bakery, ready to wash a few dishes and get Cake Walk shut down for the night. It was the least I could do, since Melissa was braving the air upstairs.</p><p>In fact, I'd been practicing a water spell; I thought that it would be perfect for a little kitchen cleanup. I'd worked through it with my familiar, Neko, three times in the past week, trying to get my mind around the controlled whirlpool that the magic required.</p><p>Not that Neko excelled at helping out with water magic. When I'd first met him, he'd been frozen into the form of a black cat statue. I'd awakened him with my very first spell. He still retained a lot of his feline features, even though he'd remained a f lesh-and-blood man for ten straight months. Okay, not straight months. Not precisely.</p><p>Neko had turned my little home upside down more than once with his parties and his exploits and his boyfriends-of-the-week, but when magical push came to enchanted shove, he'd been there for me, helping me to focus my powers and learn new ways to use my gifts.</p><p>Even when I wanted to work on water spells.</p><p>After a week of practice, I'd succeeded in gathering up water from the faucet, and I could consistently get the miniature windstorm spinning in the center of my old farmhouse sink. Each time I tried to factor in dish soap, though, my concentration fell apart, and I was left cleaning up a froth of bubbles. Or a slick river of soap. Or an ocean of foaming water, ankle deep on my kitchen f loor.</p><p>I bet that the Weird Sisters in Macbeth never needed to worry about these things. They just hired some sniveling apprentice to scrub their cauldrons clean. Eye of newt, wing of bat....</p><p>I decided that it was wiser to use conventional cleaning methods in Melissa's bakery. No reason to endanger pastries and pottery alike. Shaking my head and promising myself that I would master the spell, I reached for a sponge.</p><p>Before I could add soap, though, the bell over the door jangled its jaunty greeting. I turned around with a ready smile; I knew how to treat Melissa's clientele when I was at the counter.</p><p>And I almost sat down in the sink.</p><p>The man who stood in the doorway was drop-dead gorgeous. I couldn't compare him to a particular movie star&#x2014; he was like the best of them rolled into one.</p><p>He seemed utterly unperturbed by the August heat; there wasn't a hint of sweat on his brow, on his lip, anywhere about him. His short blond hair lay perfectly, each strand cooperating to set off the strong lines of his cheekbones, his jaw. His eyes glinted in the early-evening sunshine, a blue so light that they seemed like glass. He wore a crisp white shirt that looked as if it had just left an ironing board, and his jeans fit well enough that Levi's should pay him for the advertising. His shoulders were broad, and his waist was narrow.</p><p>He had to come from the Midwest&#x2014;corn-fed, small-town, a football quarterback if I'd ever seen one. There were country songs written about this man. He'd dated the head cheerleader; they'd been the prom king and queen. He had wanted to stay on the farm, take over for his daddy, but his mother had presented him with egg money she'd saved through the years, begging him to leave Kansas, to move to Washington for college, for a business degree.</p><p>He had broken his father's heart, even as he'd made the old man wipe away a surreptitious tear of pride. He still called home every Sunday afternoon at four, to catch up with his parents after church, after the mid-afternoon meal they called dinner. He tried to describe the big city to them, to fill them in on his life on Capitol Hill, but they never truly understood.</p><p>"I say, are you still open?" he asked.</p><p>A British accent.</p><p>Okay, so maybe I got a little carried away.

Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, fighting for their lives against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. When the unit was rescued the following morning, 18 American soldiers were dead and more than 70 badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse - more than 500 killed and over 1000 injured. Authoritative, and insightful, &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; is a minute-by-minute account of modern war. This story is now a major motion picture directed by Ridley Scott, and starring an ensemble cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewen McGregor, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Ron Eldard, Jeremy Piven and Sam Shepherd.</p><p>Journalist Mark Bowden delivers a strikingly detailed account of the 1993 nightmare operation in Mogadishu that left 18 American soldiers dead and many more wounded. This early foreign-policy disaster for the Clinton administration led to the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and a total troop withdrawal from Somalia. Bowden does not spend much time considering the context; instead he provides a moment-by-moment chronicle of what happened in the air and on the ground. His gritty narrative tells of how Rangers and elite Delta Force troops embarked on a mission to capture a pair of high-ranking deputies to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid only to find themselves surrounded in a hostile African city. Their high-tech MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters had been shot down and a number of other miscues left them trapped through the night. Bowden describes Mogadishu as a place of Mad Max-like anarchy--implying strongly that there was never any peace for the supposed peacekeepers to keep. He makes full use of the defense bureaucracy's extensive paper trail--which includes official reports, investigations, and even radio transcripts--to describe the combat with great accuracy, right down to the actual dialogue. He supplements this with hundreds of his own interviews, turning <i>Black Hawk Down</i> into a completely authentic nonfiction novel, a lively page-turner that will make readers feel like they're standing beside the embattled troops. This will quickly be realized as a modern military classic. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Ninety-nine elite American soldiers are trapped in the middle of a hostile city. As night falls, they are surrounded by thousands of enemy gunmen. Their wounded are bleeding to death. Their ammunition and supplies are dwindling. This is the story of how they got there-and how they fought their way out. This is the story of war. Black Hawk Down drops you into a crowded marketplace in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia with the U.S. Special Forces-and puts you in the middle of the most intense firefight American soldiers have fought since the Vietnam War. Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3, 1993, the soldiers of Task Force Ranger were sent on a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, locked in a desperate struggle to kill or be killed. When the unit was finally rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and dozens more badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse: more than five hundred killed and over a thousand wounded. <p>Award-winning literary journalist Mark Bowden's dramatic narrative captures this harrowing ordeal through the eyes of the young men who fought that day. He draws on his extensive interviews of participants from both sides-as well as classified combat video and radio transcripts-to bring their stories to life. A Black Hawk pilot is shot down and besieged by an angry mob, then saved by Somalis who plan to ransom him to the local warlord. A medic desperately tries to keep his grievously wounded friend alive long enough to be evacuated-only to have him bleed to death in his arms. The company clerk, who is the butt of jokes in the barracks, rises to the task and per-forms extraordinary feats of valor. </p><p>Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is a riveting look at the terror and exhilaration of combat, destined to become a classic of war reporting. </p><p>"Terrifyingly real . . .

As Tobin Buhk shows in this fast-paced narrative, the war created new opportunities to gain profits from illegal activities, to settle old scores against personal enemies under the cover of fighting the nation's enemies, to pillage, plunder, and murder amid the carnage and destruction that seemed to offer license to legitimize such crimes.

But what if, at the same time, America had discovered another strand of technology that was even more powerful than atomic science, a weapon so powerful it needs no fuel to fly at 17000 miles per second? Defence journalist Nick Cook reveals a 50-year conspiracy to surpress a technology based on anti-gravity, way ahead of its time. Gravity control: technology that can cancel out the weight of objects or be transformed into engines that produce energy from nothing, promising safe, pollution-free power, limitless propulsion - and weapons potential, The US aerospace and defence industry announced in 1956 that it was on the brink of a great scientific discovery and that the breakthrough would come before the decade was out. But it never happened; the revolution died before it had begun. That was the official version of events. The truth, however, Cook maintains, is very different, and this book traces his 10-year investigation to prove that America cracked the gravity code and classified the technology at unheard of security levels. In his pursuit of the truth, he went to the heart of US aerospace development - a regime so secret it does not officially exist. Cook&#39;s trail took him eventually to Germany, searching out a repository of technical secrets buried 50 years earlier by the Nazis. There, among a cache of unofficial projects run by the SS and hidden by the Holocaust, he learned the secret of Zero Point.</p><p></p><h2>Miller&#39;s Antique Checklist: Furniture</h2><p>This is an illustrated pocket guide to identifying and dating furniture for collectors.

Led by Frank Sanford, self-proclaimed prophet of the Second Coming of Christ--a man who may well have had a personality disorder--this repressively anti-intellectual, patriarchal community set itself apart from the world until its "scattering" in 1920. Novelist Nelson ( The Last Year of the War ), a descendant of Shiloh residents, tells the grim story in numbing detail enlivened by an "insider's" zeal. Over its 25-year lifespan, as the mission expanded, the anxiety of the members about their spiritual worthiness was exacerbated by Sanford's purging tactics. Ravaged by disease and deprivation, the colonists perdured, even after Sanford's imprisonment for manslaughter. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Our Planet Earth Teacher Supplement [With CDROM] (God's Design for Heaven &amp; Earth)</h2><p>This teacher supplement book provides an introduction on how to teach the curriculum, a supply list and answer key for each lesson, a resource guide containing suggested books, videos, and field trips, and a master supply list.

Reprint.</p><p>Continuing his tales of Cadwal, governed for generations by the Conservancy, which is dedicated to preserving the planet's natural beauty, Vance posits a scenario in which the Conservancy is now rent by factional conflict between the radical Life, Peace and Freedom Party and the conservative Chartists. LPFers ostensibly champion the cause of the Yips, happy-go-lucky descendants of runaway servants, illegal immigrants and petty criminals who are restricted to a region called Lutwen Atoll except when serving as cheap labor at Araminta Station, which is the administrative center and home to the Chartists, who uphold the original plan to restrict the spread of humanity across Cadwal. When a new, stricter Charter arrives, the inhabitants of Stroma, the only other settlement on the planet and the LPF center, are ordered to move to Araminta Station. Sinister undercurrents presage a full-scale conspiracy involving the Yips and longtime enemies of Cadwal. The popular Vance ( Ecce and Old Earth ) pens an often lively tale with some colorful moments and acerbic observations on politics and mores, although his mannered language and strained descriptions may put off the discriminating reader. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Vengeance and unrequited love are the motivating factors behind an insidious plot to destroy the Cadwal Conservancy as agents Glawen Clattuc and Eustace Chilke track an elusive enemy across several worlds only to return home at last to find a revolution in the making. Vance's polished and formal style creates an emotional gap that is difficult to bridge; consequently, his characters lack real depth. Still, this follow-up to Araminta Station (Tor, 1989) and Ecce and Old Earth (Underwood/Miller, 1991) demonstrates the author's talent for imagining worlds and environments.

It&#x2019;s been six years since her family up and left Canada to escape the prying eyes of the government and preserve their religious freedom, but Irma still misses the minor freedoms she had in their small town. She even misses the cold. This new life has not been an easy one, and Irma finds herself deserted by her husband of one year, who has left to pursue a life of drug-running, instead of working her family&#x2019;s farm. The most devastating blow for Irma is that he didn&#x2019;t take her with him, take her away, so now she&#x2019;s left to live under her father&#x2019;s domineering rule alone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Things change for Irma when a film crew moves into the empty house next door. They&#x2019;ve come to make a movie about the Mennonite community, and have made a deal with Irma&#x2019;s father to stay on their land. The director enlists Irma to work for them as a translator, as she can speak not only Spanish and English but Plattdeutsch, or Low German, the language of her people. At first bemused by the ragged and absurd crewmembers, Irma comes to embrace the passion and creative freedom of their world &#x2013; but in doing so brings on the wrath of her father, who is determined to keep her from it at all costs. When Irma&#x2019;s thirteen-year-old sister Aggie begins to come by and spend time with the crew, their father is sent over the edge with rage, and Irma is forced to make a hard decision to save not only herself, but her younger sister, and to break the dark chain of violence holding her family.<br>&nbsp;<br>The girls flee to the city, not knowing where they&#x2019;ll find food or shelter, let alone build a life, but knowing for the first time that they are free to make that choice. And even as they begin to understand the truth of the tragedy that has their family in its grip, Irma and Aggie use their love as a source of strength to help each other move on from their past lives and work toward a future that can truly become anything they want it to be.</p></p><p><p>That rare coming-of-age story able to blend the dark with the uplifting, <em>Irma Voth</em> follows a young Mennonite woman, vulnerable yet wise beyond her years, who carries a terrible family secret with her on a remarkable journey to survival and redemption.</p><p>Nineteen-year-old Irma lives in a rural Mennonite community in Mexico. She has already been cast out of her family for marrying a young Mexican ne&#x2019;er-do-well she barely knows, although she remains close to her rebellious younger sister and yearns for the lost intimacy with her mother. With a husband who proves elusive and often absent, a punishing father, and a faith in God damaged beyond repair, Irma appears trapped in an untenable and desperate situation. When a celebrated Mexican filmmaker and his crew arrive from Mexico City to make a movie about the insular community in which she was raised, Irma is immediately drawn to the outsiders and is soon hired as a translator on the set. But her father, intractable and domineering, is determined to destroy the film and get rid of the interlopers. His action sets Irma on an irrevocable path toward something that feels like freedom.</p><p>A novel of great humanity, written with dry wit, edgy humor, and emotional poignancy, <em>Irma Voth</em> is the powerful story of a young woman&#x2019;s quest to discover all that she may become in the unexpectedly rich and confounding world that lies beyond the stifling, observant community she knows.</p><p>MIRIAM TOEWS is the author of five previous novels: <i>Summer of My Amazing Luck</i>; <i>A Boy of Good Breeding</i>; <i>A</i> <i>Complicated Kindness</i> (winner of the 2004 Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award for Fiction),<i> The Flying Troutmans</i> (winner of the Rogers Writers&#x2019; Trust Fiction Prize) and <i>Irma Voth</i>, and one work of non-fiction, <i>Swing Low: A Life</i>.

Philbee Jhorn</b><br><br>Though my superiors have not seen fit to give me full details as to the Emperor's purpose in seeking further information on the Forest Moon of Endor, I am filing this report as requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will state up front that, since I was never given specifics as to the information of interest, this report will perforce be broad and general.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have had no training in planetary survey techniques, I have avoided details of a technical nature.<br><br>The trip out here was horrendous.&nbsp;&nbsp;Endor itself is a silvery gas-giant that is difficult to reach even by convoluted hyperspace paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in the attachments, the huge planet is encircled by banded high clouds and orbited by nine moons of varying sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest moon, called the Forest Moon of Endor, is the size of a small, rocky planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Forest Moon is the focus of this report, I have designated it Endor for simplicity.<br><br>The Endor system is extremely remote, not just from the Core systems but also from other Imperial bases, common trade routes, and other inhabited worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of our transport claimed that simply reaching Endor involves half a dozen tricky hyperspace maneuvers (something to do with the enormous gravity of the gas-giant and the uncharted space in the sector).&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain rather snappishly told me to leave him alone, even after I informed him that I was on a fact-finding mission for the Emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp;(His name and service number are on file, should anyone wish to initiate formal disciplinary action.)&nbsp;&nbsp;These navigational uncertainties may rule out the establishment of an important base in this system.<br><br>Given such circumstances, it is no surprise that numerous ships have crash-landed on the Forest Moon, making it something of a "desert island" in space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lush and wild environment provides resourceful victims the opportunity to eke out an existence, but I would envy no one the job of living under these primitive conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me Coruscant any day.<br><br>However, I do not know the Emperor's purposes here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that Endor is isolated, yet able to support human life without expensive and difficult environment systems, this large moon mav be an ideal place.&nbsp;&nbsp;My job is only to provide information, add recommendations if I feel they are relevant, and correct the numerous sketchy errors made by the initial survey team.&nbsp;&nbsp;If only they had done their job well enough in the first place, I would not have been given this redundant assignment.<br><br>(For example, the report of the first survey team stated that the only significant life-forms inhabiting the moon were the fuzzy and annoying Ewoks, who were presumed to be harmless.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did the survey team entirely miss the deadly giant Gorax, but also bloodthirsty condor dragons, packs of tall and timid yuzzums, and an entire settlement of off-planet marauders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of this first team are a disgrace to Imperial military service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically their only useful bit of information is that the furry Ewoks pose no serious threat and should be exterminated strictly because of their nuisance value.)<br><br>Of course, the first team's lack of thoroughness may be understandable if they were as poorly equipped as my team proved to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the transport ship dropped us off and shuttled our supplies down, we were appalled to find that only a group of two-rider AT-ST scout transports had been assigned to the entire task of covering a world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The food packs contained only the worst sorts of rations, leftovers from the Clone Wars, no doubt!&nbsp;&nbsp;The garment bins contained ice-assault suits decommissioned after the raid on Hoth!&nbsp;&nbsp;I had heard grumblings about incompetence, nepotism, and corruption in the Imperial Navy, and now I had no doubt.<br><br>Sworn to duty, though, my team and I set to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;We consisted of four scientifically trained troopers plus five stormtrooper escorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We climbed aboard several jerky scout transports and clomped off through the undergrowth.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the AT-STs were in need of serious maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other members of my team performed the required duties, while I sat back and observed (as was my job).&nbsp;&nbsp;I took copious notes.<br><br>Much of the surface is densely covered with legendary tall trees, giving it the name of Forest Moon; but other parts of Endor are rocky savannas and snow-topped mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Badlands to the south are dotted with sulfur springs and perilous pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleak, rocky highlands are inhabited by the giant Gorax.&nbsp;&nbsp;The low gravity of the Endor moon encourages living things to become large, not just the mammoth conifer trees, but also many indigenous species.<br><br>The dense, primeval forest is the most striking feature of Endor, and most likely to cause serious difficulties for Imperial construction projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overhead, through the tapering treetops, the bright planet Endor fills much of the sky like a mirror, breaking through the blue of daylight or shining down like a spotlight in the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;(One side benefit of this would be the reduced cost of illumination for a security perimeter on any proposed base.)<br><br>Flowers grow high above the ground, sprouting from wind-borne seeds that have lodged in damp crevices in the enormous tree limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their colors are so bright and so varied as to give one a headache, and even with my facemask filters toggled to their densest settings, the disgusting pollens still managed to penetrate, making me miserable with extraterrestrial allergies.<br><br>The thickly overgrown forest floor, with its groves of free-palms and ferns, proved extremely hazardous even for the flexible capabilities of our scout transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Imperial engineers think they can simply land on the moon, ignore the indigenous life-forms, and set up their base of operations without difficulty, they're in for a large, unpleasant surprise.<br><br>While our AT-STs could maneuver through some of the thickest foliage, I'd consider it impossible for a larger AT-AT to make its way beyond the largest clearings.&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not preclude, however, the use of such armored walkers for intimidation around, say, a big landing platform in the depths of the forest.<br><br>Still, even our smaller scout walker suffered several mishaps on our plodding journey through the forest: I can't begin to list all the times we stumbled in treacherous and hidden gullies concealed by the underbrush.&nbsp;&nbsp;We wasted many hours disassembling twisted metal knee joints and repairing them, occasionally even battering bent components with rocks just to make them fit back into their appropriate sockets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, our AT-ST repair kits contained none of the spare parts we needed.<br><b>The Forest Moon of Endor orbits a silvery gas giant--called </b><b><i>Endor,</i></b><b> for you dim-witted readers--which rises high and bright every day.</b><br><br> The animal life on Endor is none too friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I couldn't begin to say whether any of the game is edible; our old military rations were tasteless, but even that seemed preferable to eating some stringy, musty rodent grubbing in the underbrush.)<br><br>While our scout walker was being repaired-- again--several of us explored the perimeter and encountered a dangerous decoy creature, which we named a tempter.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempter lives inside a dark, hollow stump, waiting for other predators to pass by.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempter apparently exudes a provocative smell that makes predators salivate.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shadows of its tree den, it opens its yawning black mouth, using its articulated tongue as a lure.<br><br>The tempter's tongue is an astonishing piece of camouflage, with a small and furry appendage that looks just like a particularly stupid rodent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue appendage has its own muscles and even a dense nerve cluster that may act as a primitive secondary brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decoy appendage moves, making strange and tempting sounds, then ducks back into the blackness of the hollow tree.<br><b>The open skies of Endor, showing only primitive trees and dirty "natural" beauty, are ripe for exploitation by anyone who can stomach this primeval world.</b><br><br>When one of our scouts reached into the hollow trunk to secure the rodent specimen, the tempter nearly bit his entire hand off.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we struggled to free him, the gray, serpentine form lunged out of its hiding place in the trunk, hoping to finish off the wounded prey.&nbsp;&nbsp;We blasted it, then dissected the remains of the carcass.<br><br>The tempter looks like a long, blunt eel, with pale, fleshy skin covered with a thick mucus that allows it to slither into tight spots and also to strike outward, freeing itself in a flash.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently once it has had its meal, the tempter cleans blood and debris from the area, then lies in wait again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the lair in the hollow trunk is filled with bones and refuse, the tempter must move out--probably at night, under the silvery light of the gas-giant, slithering among the free-palms to find a new place to set up a trap.<br><br>We tended our wounded comrade and bandaged his arm, but his injury greatly diminished his use to us for the rest of the survey operation.<br>The most common creatures on Endor are the obnoxious Ewoks, feral and deceptively cute hairy things that seem to consider themselves our equals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewoks practically infest the forests with their tree villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would give me no greater pleasure than to burn down these clumsy and primitive structures, but the task is far too great for our small party.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, though, that if the Emperor intends to make any substantial use of this Forest Moon, he see to it that the Ewoks are exterminated before they can cause significant damage with their ignorant meddling.<br><br>One member of our team unwisely became enamored of the Ewok society and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;He squandered valuable time studying them and wrote copious descriptions of his impressions, though he did not bother to do a single dissection to add to our <i>real</i> knowledge of these. . . these creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reprimanded him severely for his misplaced priorities, but I include his observations here for completeness, though I have rewritten some of the insipid and overblown prose.<br><br>The Ewok civilization is extremely primitive and simple, with little of unique interest to warrant study by already overworked Imperial exoanthropologists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, by sheer accident, the Ewoks have performed many spectacular engineering feats, including catapults, waterwheels, and skin gliders that allow them to soar on the winds and remain aloft for a long time in the small moon's low gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the gmff engineer on our team admitted his grudging admiration for their discoveries.<br><br>It is humorous to watch the Ewoks attempt to create weapons from the crudest raw materials: stone knives, spears, bows and arrows, nets, clumsy animal traps, even catapults.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing the Ewoks invent would have a chance of even scratching our Imperial weaponry, though the contest (and resulting Ewok slaughter!) might be amusing to watch.</p><h2>The Splendor of Cuba: 450 Years of Architecture and Interiors</h2><p>An unprecedented tour of stunning and architecturally significant Cuban palacios, mansions, and private homes that have been meticulously preserved, previously un-photographed, and inaccessible to visitors.

It presents not the Cuba of Castro&#x2019;s era, with its derelict buildings and peeling paint, but the opulent world of the Spanish Creole aristocracy of the colonial period, with its Mudejar craftsmanship and baroque palacios, the sugarcane plantations (ingenios) and coffee plantations (cafetales), and classically inspired grand mansions.

The American Indian Movement became prominent by that action, and Chaat and Warrior chart its fortunes through the three years culminating in both Nixon&#39;s reelection and the siege at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where armed AIM sympathizers held off federal agents for eight weeks. The period between Alcatraz and Wounded Knee, the authors write, &#34;was for American Indians every bit as significant as the counterculture was for young whites, or the civil rights movement for blacks.&#34;A well-documented, highly readable history of three turbulent years in the history of Native America. American Indian radical politics first drew international attention in the early winter of 1969, when an unknown number of activists, certainly fewer than a hundred, occupied Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. The American Indian Movement, an activist organization, grew to prominence through that action, bringing fame (or notoriety, depending on your viewpoint) to Richard Oakes, Russell Means, Dennis Banks, Browning Pipestem, and John Trudell; it also helped focus Indian activists on developing what movement strategist Clyde Warrior called ``true Indian philosophy geared to modern times.'' Native historians Chaat and Warrior (a former Kirkus contributor and Stanford historian; Tribal Secrets, 1994) chart AIM's fortunes through the three years culminating in both Nixon's reelection and the siege at Wounded Knee, S.D., where armed AIM sympathizers held off federal agents for eight weeks while becoming an international cause c&#x201a;l&#x160;bre. The period between Alcatraz and Wounded Knee, the authors write, ``was for American Indians every bit as significant as the counterculture was for young whites, or the civil rights movement for blacks.'' They make their case with admirable balance, noting that the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, usually the heavy in books of this sort, was full of well-meaning and sympathetic individuals, and that AIM had its share of bad actors, including people who at Alcatraz busied themselves ``bootlegging liquor and thrashing residents who criticized the leadership or who asked too many questions about finances.'' Still, the authors argue, most of the activists who put themselves on the line at Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, and elsewhere gave powerful voice to the voiceless peoples hitherto tucked away on reservations, ``the most ignored population in the United States.'' This is essential reading for anyone interested in the course of contemporary American Indian politics. (25 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

After a brief craze, fondue went the way of lava lamps, shag carpeting, and leisure suits, its pot and skewers retired to the back of a high kitchen cupboard where they're forgotten until the next garage sale. Now, however, fondue is making a comeback, and--like Barbie--it's gotten a whole new look. In <i>Fondue</i>, Rick Rodgers takes the three basic fondues--cheese, chocolate, and fried--and mixes in the flavors of the '90s--everything from sun-dried tomatoes to espresso. He even adds a fourth category, Asian fondue, for those fat- and calorie-conscious cooks who prefer their food simmered in broth. Swordfish Fondue with Tapenade Mayonnaise; Gingered Curry and Cheddar Fondue; Vietnamese Beef Fondue with Rice Vinegar Stock and Anchovy-Pineapple Sauce--the '60s were never like this! In <i>Fondue</i>, Rick Rodgers proves that, once again, it's hip to dip.<p>Rick Rodgers is the author of more than thirty-five cookbooks, including the bestselling 101 series (<em>Thanksgiving 101</em>, <em>Christmas 101</em>, <em>Barbecues 101</em>) and beloved cookbooks on everything from fondue to slow cookers to comfort food.

Return now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, enter at your own risk into the dark and dank lair known as the White Horse Tavern, and meet Walter Gibson, the mind behind The Shadow, and Lester Dent, creator of Doc Savage, as they challenge one another to discover what is real and what is pulp.<br>For Gibson, writing a new novel about The Shadow every month is a way to evade his own dark past. For his rival, Dent, creating Doc Savage is an attempt to bring the light of better days to desperate millions. In their lives and loves they are as different from one another as the heroes they've created. But now the hideous murder of the fringe pulp writer H. P. Lovecraft - victim of a mysterious death that literally makes the skin crawl - will set these two men on a collision course with each other, and face to face with a terrifying and very real evil that could have sprung from the pages of their own pulps.<br>From the palaces and battlefields of warlord-plagued China to the seedy waterfronts of Providence, Rhode Island; from frozen seas and cursed islands to the labyrinthine tunnels and secret temples of New York's Chinatown, Dent and Gibson will find themselves in a dangerous race to stop a madman destined to create a new empire of pure evil. Together with the young pulp writer L. Ron Hubbard, a mysterious stranger, and a sexy psychic with a chicken, they will finally step out from behind their creations to take part in a heroic journey far greater than any story they have imagined. Their quest will force Gibson to look beyond the shadows and discover the true evil that lurks in the hearts of men, while Dent will learn that the nature of a true hero is not found in a fictional superman, but in the faith of the woman who challenges death itself to love him.</p><p><b>Paul Malmont</b> works in advertising.

But he didn't want to be here drinking with the youthful and ambitious president of the American Fiction Guild, who had been hectoring him relentlessly to speak about his writing at the weekly gathering of pulp mag writers in the Grand Salon of the old Hotel Knickerbocker. John Nanovic, his ed at Street &amp; Smith, had begged, pleaded, and in the end agreed to pay for a few of this evening's drinks if he would agree to do it. Nanovic had told Gibson that it was important for him, as the number one bestselling mag writer in America, to take an interest in the new writers, the young writers. To help groom them. Gibson felt that what Nanovic really wanted him to do was to find his successor in case he stumbled in front of a trolley car some drunken evening. Ultimately he had to admit that it was a fair concern for an editor to have about him.</p><p></p><p>So, here he was having drinks with Lafayette Ron Hubbard, a writer of moderately popular but pedestrian (in Gibson's opinion) westerns, and at twenty-five, fifteen years younger than he. One of the new writers. One of the young ones. They were seated at a small table next to the bar and treating themselves to waiter service. Hubbard was one of those writers who acted like they really cared about writing and had launched into a theory that the sort of adventure pulp Gibson wrote was somehow less valid than the westerns and two-fisted tales he wrote because at least his stories were based on history or reality.</p><p></p><p>Gibson knew the kid was impressed by him. Hubbard had practically been begging him for a sit-down for weeks. Every now and then Gibson would see Hubbard looking around the saloon as if he could recognize somebody he knew who might come over and interrupt the conversation. If that had happened, he might then have the opportunity to say to them, "Excuse me, but can't you see I'm having drinks with Walter Gibson? That's right, the guy who writes T<i>he Shadow Magazine</i>. Well, I know <i>The Shadow</i> byline is Maxwell Grant, but that's a company name, a Street &amp; Smith name. Trust me. Walter Gibson is Maxwell Grant. Walter Gibson writes <i>The Shadow Magazine</i>. We're just talking about writing." But he recognized no one and no one recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Gibson had seen several writers that he knew come through already; the Street &amp; Smith building was just up the road at Fifteenth and Seventh, and the tavern was popular with writers who had just been roughed up by eds and by the eds who had applied the beating. George Bruce, the air-ace writer, had been and gone; Elmer Smith, the rocket jock, and Norvell Page, the fright guy, were still drinking in a corner. But he hadn't invited either to join them. As a rule Gibson didn't like other mag writers; he found them too self-denigrating yet self-important at the same time. He much preferred the company of the magicians whose books and articles he often ghosted.</p><p></p><p>He kind of liked Hubbard, though. The kid was eager and acted like he thought his shit smelled like roses, a confidence most other writers lacked. In a one-draft world a man had to believe that every word he wrote was right. Gibson knew he had quickly muscled out old Arthur Brooks, a man Gibson had no use for whatsoever, who as head of the Guild had run the organization as a lazy gentlemen's social club. Hubbard had plans for the Guild, but Gibson didn't really care to know what they were. He knew that Hubbard had lived in New York for several years a while back with a wife and a daughter, and that they had all moved back to Washington State for a while, and that he had left them behind in Washington and come back to New York alone just a few months ago. Gibson could only venture a guess why; the Depression had made it so that sometimes a man couldn't afford to bring his family with him when he went looking for work. But the last thing Gibson wanted to do was ask another man why he had left his wife and child.</p><p></p><p>"What's real? What's pulp? Right, Ron?" He unbuttoned his collar and loosened his tie knot. "Okay. Here's a story. For the sake of argument, let's call it the Tale of the Sweet Flower War. This is a story filled with blood and cruelty and fear and mystery and love and passion and vengeance and villains," he said. "It began with the arrival of a strange mist which rolled in from the harbor and seemed to fill the streets of Chinatown. Those who were superstitious felt it was the cloak of death. Those who weren't superstitious, and their numbers were few, only felt it was another reason to hate living here." Walter spoke rapidly; the hard emphasis of his consonants tended to resemble a staccato drumbeat, and his fingers twitched mildly as he spoke, involuntarily typing his words onto the table or against his leg or into the air as fast as he spoke them. Gibson's energy always seemed to keep him in motion. His friend Harry Houdini had once told him he seemed to vibrate, even when he was standing still.</p><p></p><p>"Here Chinatown? Or San Francisco's?" Hubbard asked with a vaguely worldly air that implied he had traveled some in his time and knew both intimately: a warning to Gibson that he'd better have his facts straight.</p><p></p><p>"New York. Here." The tone of Gibson's voice let Hubbard know not to interrupt the storytelling again unless it was something important. "The deadly fog rolled over the tiny enclave thirty years ago during the great tong wars, when the red flag of war flew over the tallest building in Chinatown."</p><p></p><p>"Tong?" Hubbard made the same mistake again and winced a little, knowing that Gibson's next breath would have explained it.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient organizations with mysterious roots going way back in Chinese history. Brutal, cruel, and sadistic. Mostly they imported opium, slave girls, and indentured workers from China.</p><p></p><p>"In 1909, the year of the menacing mist, the biggest tong in America was the On Leong group. They controlled everything in the matter of things Chinese from Frisco to New York. There were other tongs around at the time, but the only serious rivals were the Hip Sing. Their boss was a fella about your age, everyone knew him as Mock Duck, and he had a habit, when he got into a brawl, of whipping out two pistols, closing his eyes, and firing blindly until everyone was dead or running for their lives. You can laugh if you want, but legend had it that this was a very effective street-fighting technique.</p><p></p><p>"Well, those that said that something sinister would emerge from the shadow which had fallen over Chinatown were right. One day Sweet Flower came to town. Now she was, by all accounts, a beautiful and delicate virgin. She had remarkable long, slender fingers and could play a variety of Chinese instruments with skill and grace. A slave, of course, smuggled in by a slaver and probably destined for a life of prostitution. But one of the On Leong leaders saw her, fell in love with her, and he had his men steal her from the slaver. Or rescue her, if you prefer. And, he married her. She was sixteen, and on her wedding night he possessed her in every way that a man can possess a woman. And she was happy with her station in life.</p><p></p><p>"At first, all the slaver wanted was proper restitution for his loss. But the On Leong man refused to pay for what he considered to be true love. He told the slaver to go to hell. The slaver went to another tong, the Hip Sing. A truce was declared and the two parties sat down for formal negotiations. Now this was at a time when the tong fighters, the hatchet men, the <i>boo how doy</i>, were killing each other at the rate of two or three a week. So for these two tongs to actually sit down together in the same room and hold a peaceful discussion..." He made a futile gesture. "Chinatown did not hold its collective breath."</p><p></p><p>"The negotiations did not go well for the Hip Sing. Once again, they were told in no uncertain terms where they and their demands could go. All things considered, it's pretty remarkable that any man walked out of the tearoom alive that day. That night, however, was a different story. While her husband slept, someone broke into their house and cut off each and every one of Sweet Flower's slender and delicate little fingers."</p><p></p><p>"Mock Duck?"</p><p></p><p>The White Horse Tavern served its own blend of scotch, and each bottle was topped by a cork with a white tin horse rearing up. There was a cork on their table now; it was usually given to the customer who had put the polish on a bottle, and he had, several drinks ago. Gibson picked it up now, idly playing with it.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe. It was probably the vile slaver. And, in fact, Mock Duck delivered him over to the On Leong for whatever justice they chose to administer. But it wasn't enough and over the next couple of months, over fifty men from both sides were killed, and hundreds more were crippled or maimed in the fighting. Now what's really incredible about this is that we're talking about a neighborhood that takes up maybe a square mile and is made up of only a dozen or so streets. So relatively, it's a truly gruesome amount of men carving each other up."</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds! C'mon! That's pulp."</p><p></p><p>Gibson cleared his throat. "In those days the center of Chinese social life was the old Chinese Theater. It's still there; you can go down and see it for yourself. It's all boarded up now.</p><p></p><p>"At the time of the Sweet Flower War there was a famous comedian named Ah Hoon.

In his palavering, stream-of-conscious style that has marked him as one of the major writers and innovators of postwar European literature, Hrabal gives a humorous and at times moving account of life in Prague under Nazi occupation, Communism, and the brief euphoria following the revolution of 1989 when anything seemed possible, even pink tanks. Interspersed are fragmented memories of trips taken to Britain �&#x20ac;&#x201d; as he attempted to track down every location mentioned in Eliot�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s �&#x20ac;&#x153;The Waste Land�&#x20ac; �&#x20ac;&#x201d; and the United States, where he ends up in one of Dylan Thomas�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s haunts comparing the waitresses to ones he knew in Prague. The result is a masterful blend of personal history and fee association rendered in a prose as powerful as it is poetic..</p><p>Bohumil Hrabal was born in 1914 in Brno-Zidenice, Moravia. He received a degree in Law from Prague&#39;s Charles University, and lived in Prague since the late 1940s. In the 1950s he worked as a manual laborer in the Kladno ironworks, from which he drew inspiration for his &#34;hyper-realist&#34; texts he was writing at that time. He won international acclaim for such books as I Served the King of England and Too Loud a Solitude. Hrabal is considered, along with Jaroslav Hasek and Karel Capek, one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century, and perhaps the most important in the postwar period.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Czech</p><h2>Demeter and Persephone: Homeric Hymn Number Two.</h2><p>A book on a mythological tale adapted for children with lovely color illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Hank: The Life of Charles Bukowski</h2><p>Traces the life of the controversial American poet, describes his experiences wandering across the country, and discusses his major writings</p><p>With Charles Bukowski, as with many autobiographical writers, one gets curious to see what his life was really like and how the stories and poems relate to it chronologically. In this case the question is also, "Does Bukowski live up to the myth surrounding him?" Addressing this question in his biography, Cherkovski reproduces many favorite poems and little fragments of prose and then analyzes them insightfully in relation to the writer's life. Cherkovski was a good friend of Bukowski during the late Sixties, and his tales of their exploits together will make the average Bukowski idolator jealous. After all, what fan wouldn't want to join with the big man himself in editing a magazine called Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns and even get to pour beer and egg whites all over the manuscripts intended for rejection? Cherkovski's style is a bit repetitious, but his compassion and respect for his subject are almost heartwarmingly ever-present. He gives fans and nonfans alike another, if not totally different, picture of the great Bukowski.<br><i>- Louis Cone, New York</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flesh and Stone: The Body and the City in Western Civilization</h2><p>A description of urban life from a body sense perspective spans 2,500 years journeys through ancient Athens, Hadrian&#39;s Rome, medieval and revolutionary Paris, Renaissance Venice, Edwardian London, and contemporary New York. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Richard Sennett teaches at New York University.An expansive history of Western civilization's evolving conception of the human body and that concept's influence on the erection of cities. Sennett (Sociology/New York Univ.; The Conscience of the Eye, 1991, etc.) argues that the homogenization of contemporary culture is aided and abetted by the failure of modern architecture and urban planning to accommodate the physical and sensory needs of the human body. This is more than mere postmodern sterility to Sennett. He sees this failing as an extension of the ``enduring problem'' of Western civilization: the inability or refusal of those with the power to build cities to honor ``the dignity of the body and diversity of human bodies.'' From Pericles' Athens to Robert Moses's New York, Sennett incorporates discussions of sexuality, religion, politics, medicine, and economics into a historical grand tour of great cities whose buildings, streets, and public squares elevated the status of the ruling elite and diminished that of common citizens. Along the way, we find out how it felt to witness an execution by guillotine in revolutionary Paris, attend a Roman banquet, and observe a trial in ancient Greece, where courtrooms reflected the demands of a participatory democracy--three-foot-high walls and a jury box big enough for the minimum 201 jurors. Though Sennett ably surveys the ideological landscapes of the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, these quotidian revelations are what enliven the book. By exposing the principles of individualism and personal comfort that form the most fundamental assumptions of 20th-century consumer culture, Sennett reminds modern readers that they trade a great deal for comfort--namely their engagement with one another. In so doing, he debunks the myth that the evolution of cities has been one of unfettered progress, or that progress is synonymous with improvement. Passionate, exhaustively researched, and original.

Garrick Mallery's report on the picture-writing of the American Indians. Except for a special section on petroglyphs (rock-writing), most of the examples are roughly contemporary with the writing of the report and were gathered by ethnologists, explorers, and expeditions to reservations. As such, the emphasis is on the meaning of the pictures, and the differences between the styles of picture-writing of the various tribes.<br>Included are nearly 1,300 pictures and 54 plates illustrating the material which Col. Mallery narrates. Examples include: knotted cords, notched or marked sticks and wampum; mnemonic pictures for remembering songs, traditions, treaties, and accounts; the calendars (winter counts) of Lone-Dog and Battiste Good; maps, notices of visits, condition and warning; tribal designations, clan designations, tattoo marks (especially from the Haida); designations of authority, property, and personal names; religious symbols of the supernatural and of mythic animals; symbols used on charms and amulets, in religious ceremonies and in the burial of the dead; pictographs of cult associations, of daily events, and of games; historic records such as the Indian account of the Battle of Little Big Horn; records of migrations, hunts, and notable events; biographic records; significance of colors; picture-writing as it became conventionalized; and much more. There are also sections on interpretation of pictographs and on the detection of frauds, and comparative material from other cultures.<br>For anthropologists, sociologists, historians, or artists, Col. Mallery's account is still the basic study of North American Indian picture-writing, Its wealth of pictorial material is not to be found anywhere else. And since most of the material was collected by contemporaries while picturing was still an important method of communication, the ethnologists were often assisted by the Indians themselves in decoding the pictographs and discovering the wealth of information that was conveyed by them.</p><p></p><h2>Leo the Lop (Tail Two) (Serendipity)</h2><p>Even a cute and furry rabbit can be brave.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Book Of Gourd Craft: 22 Projects * 55 Decorative Techniques * 300 Inspirational Designs</h2><p>&#x201c;This book covers growing, harvesting, and curing as well as crafting and finishing....The projects, are artistic and imaginative and cover all techniques of dealing with gourds.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>. &#x201c;Lots of inspiring gourd crafting techniques and ideas&#x2014;I highly recommend The Complete Book of Gourd Craft...its 300 color photos... depict many...amazing things you can create...plenty of detailed information.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Organic Gardening.</i><br></p><p>Gourds have been used for centuries as containers and decorative objects.

The celebration was somewhat marred by debates over wolf reintroduction, road improvement, resort building, and &#34;bioprospecting,&#34; the search for economically useful plant materials. Paul Schullery, a longtime resident and student of the park, tells us that such debates are not new. In his deeply personal yet sweeping history of Yellowstone, he shows that the place known from the start as &#34;Wonderland&#34; has always been the subject of pro- and anti-development forces, has always been seen through sometimes bitterly contrasting points of view. With balance and grace, Schullery weaves his narrative through countless such arguments, noting that &#34;Today&#39;s parks, for all the press of humanity lined up to get in, still seem short of friends, or at least lacking in just the right combination of friends to ensure adequate budgets and reasonable protection.&#34; His fine book may help widen Yellowstone&#39;s circle of champions.Yellowstone National Park is beloved passionately and, as with all objects of passion, it generates heated feelings and has for over 125 years. Created in 1872, Yellowstone has been at the center of efforts to conserve the nation's once vast western wilderness. In turn Yellowstone's history has demonstrated how complex those efforts to conserve it have been. As Schullery writes, "We inherited this great humming thing . . . Ever since then we have imagined ourselves wise enough to control it and have rushed to judge what is wrong with it. And every time we looked hard enough, we discovered that there was more wrong with our judgment than with Yellowstone."<br><br>This marvelously detailed book skillfully and objectively traces the park's social and ecological history from Pleistocene times to the present. Searching for Yellowstone is an absolute "must read" for anyone wanting to understand why the park is engraved in the American consciousness.<br></p><h2>Fox&#39;s Socks (Tales From Acorn Wood)</h2><p><p><strong>Happy Birthday Acorn Wood!</strong></p><p>Join the birthday celebrations in Acorn Wood with four new 15th anniversary editions of the ever-popular<i>Postman Bear</i>,<i>Fox's Socks</i>,<i>Hide-and-Seek Pig</i>and<i>Rabbit's Nap</i>.</p><p>Poor old Fox has lost his socks - can you help him find them?

Throughout The Twilight Saga (<em>Twilight</em>, <em>New Moon</em>, and <em>Eclipse</em>), Stephenie Meyer has emulated great love stories--<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>--with the fated, yet perpetually doomed love of Bella (the human girl) and Edward (the vampire who feeds on animals instead of humans). In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the fourth and final installment in the series, Bella&#x2019;s story plays out in some unexpected ways. The ongoing conflicts that made this series so compelling--a human girl in love with a vampire, a werewolf in love with a human girl, the generations-long feud between werewolves and vampires--resolve pretty quickly, apparently so that Meyer could focus on Bella&#x2019;s latest opportunity for self-sacrifice: giving her life for someone she loves even more than Edward. How close she comes to actually making that sacrifice is questionable, which is a big shift from the earlier books. Even though you knew Bella would make it through somehow, the threats to her life, and to her relationship with Edward, had previously always felt real. It&#x2019;s as if Meyer was afraid of hurting her characters too much, which is unfortunate, because the pain Bella suffered at losing Edward in <em>New Moon</em>, and the pain Jacob suffered at losing Bella again and again, are the fire and the heart that drive the whole series. Diehard fans will stick with Bella, Edward, and Jacob for as many twists and turns as possible, but after most of the characters get what they want with little sacrifice, some readers may have a harder time caring what happens next.

He is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at MIT.Everyone has a theory of human nature. Everyone has to anticipate the behavior of others, and that means we all need theories about what makes people tick. A tacit theory of human nature&#x2014;that behavior is caused by thoughts and feelings&#x2014;is embedded in the very way we think about people. We fill out this theory by introspecting on our own minds and assuming that our fellows are like ourselves, and by watching people's behavior and filing away generalizations. We absorb still other ideas from our intellectual climate: from the expertise of authorities and the conventional wisdom of the day.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our theory of human nature is the wellspring of much in our lives. We consult it when we want to persuade or threaten, inform or deceive. It advises us on how to nurture our marriages, bring up our children, and control our own behavior. Its assumptions about learning drive our educational policy; its assumptions about motivation drive our policies on economics, law, and crime. And because it delineates what people can achieve easily, what they can achieve only with sacrifice or pain, and what they cannot achieve at all, it affects our values: what we believe we can reasonably strive for as individuals and as a society. Rival theories of human nature are entwined in different ways of life and different political systems, and have been a source of much conflict over the course of history.</p><p>For millennia, the major theories of human nature have come from religion. The Judeo-Christian tradition, for example, offers explanations for much of the subject matter now studied by biology and psychology. Humans are made in the image of God and are unrelated to animals.&nbsp; Women are derivative of men and destined to be ruled by them.&nbsp; The mind is an immaterial substance: it has powers possessed by no purely physical structure, and can continue to exist when the body dies.&nbsp; The mind is made up of several components, including a moral sense, an ability to love, a capacity for reason that recognizes whether an act conforms to ideals of goodness, and a decision faculty that chooses how to behave. Although the decision faculty is not bound by the laws of cause and effect, it has an innate tendency to choose sin. Our cognitive and perceptual faculties work accurately because God implanted ideals in them that correspond to reality and because he coordinates their functioning with the outside world. Mental health comes from recognizing God's purpose, choosing good and repenting sin, and loving God and one's fellow humans for God's sake.</p><p>The Judeo-Christian theory is based on events narrated in the Bible. We know that the human mind has nothing in common with the minds of animals because the Bible says that humans were created separately. We know that the design of women is based on the design of men because in the second telling of the creation of women Eve was fashioned from the rib of Adam. Human decisions cannot be the inevitable effects of some cause, we may surmise, because God held Adam and Eve responsible for eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, implying that they could have chosen otherwise. Women are dominated by men as punishment for Eve's disobedience, and men and women inherit the sinfulness of the first couple.</p><p>The Judeo-Christian conception is still the most popular theory of human nature in the United States. According to recent polls, 76 percent of Americans believe in the biblical account of creation, 79 percent believe that the miracles in the Bible actually took place, 76 percent believe in angels, the devil, and other immaterial souls, 67 percent believe they will exist in some form after their death, and only 15 percent believe that Darwin's theory of evolution is the best explanation for the origin of human life on Earth. Politicians on the right embrace the religious theory explicitly, and no mainstream politician would dare contradict it in public. But the modern sciences of cosmology, geology, biology, and archaeology have made it impossible for a scientifically literate person to believe that the biblical story of creation actually took place. As a result, the Judeo-Christian theory of human nature is no longer explicitly avowed by most academics, journalists, social analysts, and other intellectually engaged people.</p><p><br>Nonetheless, every society must operate with a theory of human nature, and our intellectual mainstream is committed to another one. The theory is seldom articulated or overtly embraced, but it lies at the heart of a vast number of beliefs and policies. Bertrand Russell wrote, "Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day." For intellectuals today, many of those convictions are about psychology and social relations. I will refer to those convictions as the Blank Slate: the idea that the human mind has no inherent structure and can be inscribed at will by society or ourselves.</p><p>That theory of human nature&#x2014;namely, that it barely exists&#x2014;is the topic of this book. Just as religions contain a theory of human nature, so theories of human nature take on some of the functions of religion, and the Blank Slate has become the secular religion of modern intellectual life. It is seen as a source of values, so the fact that it is based on a miracle&#x2014;a complex mind arising out of nothing&#x2014;is not held against it. Challenges to the doctrine from skeptics and scientists have plunged some believers into a crisis of faith and have led others to mount the kinds of bitter attacks ordinarily aimed at heretics and infidels. And just as many religious traditions eventually reconciled themselves to apparent threats from science (such as the revolutions of Copernicus and Darwin), so, I argue, will our values survive the demise of the Blank Slate.</p><p>The chapters in this part of the book (Part I) are about the ascendance of the Blank Slate in modern intellectual life, and about the new view of human nature and culture that is beginning to challenge it. In succeeding parts we will witness the anxiety evoked by this challenge (Part II) and see how the anxiety may be assuaged (Part III). Then I will show how a richer conception of human nature can provide insight into language, thought, social life, and morality (Part IV) and how it can clarify controversies on politics, violence, gender, childrearing, and the arts (Part V). Finally I will show how the passing of the Blank Slate is less disquieting, and in some ways less revolutionary, than it first appears (Part VI).</p><p><b>Chapter 1<br><br>The Official Theory</b></p><p>"Blank slate" is a loose translation of the medieval Latin term tabula rasa&#x2014;literally, "scraped tablet." It is commonly attributed to the philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), though in fact he used a different metaphor. Here is the famous passage from <b>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</b>:</p><p>Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper void of all characters, without any ideas. How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from experience.</p><p>Locke was taking aim at theories of innate ideas in which people were thought to be born with mathematical ideals, eternal truths, and a notion of God. His alternative theory, empiricism, was intended both as a theory of psychology&#x2014;how the mind works&#x2014;and as a theory of epistemology&#x2014;how we come to know the truth. Both goals helped motivate his political philosophy, often honored as the foundation of liberal democracy. Locke opposed dogmatic justifications for the political status quo, such as the authority of the church and the divine right of kings, which had been touted as self-evident truths. He argued that social arrangements should be reasoned out from scratch and agreed upon by mutual consent, based on knowledge that any person could acquire. Since ideas are grounded in experience, which varies from person to person, differences of opinion arise not because one mind is equipped to grasp the truth and another is defective, but because the two minds have had different histories. Those differences therefore ought to be tolerated rather than suppressed. Locke's notion of a blank slate also undermined a hereditary royalty and aristocracy, whose members could claim no innate wisdom or merit if their minds had started out as blank as everyone else's. It also spoke against the institution of slavery, because slaves could no longer be thought of as innately inferior or subservient.</p><p>During the past century the doctrine of the Blank Slate has set the agenda for much of the social sciences and humanities. As we shall see, psychology has sought to explain all thought, feeling, and behavior with a few simple mechanisms of learning. The social sciences have sought to explain all customs and social arrangements as a product of the socialization of children by the surrounding culture: a system of words, images, stereotypes, role models, and contingencies of reward and punishment. A long and growing list of concepts that would seem natural to the human way of thinking (emotions, kinship, the sexes, illness, nature, the world) are now said to have been "invented" or "socially constructed."</p><p><br>The Blank Slate has also served as a sacred scripture for political and ethical beliefs. According to the doctrine, any differences we see among races, ethnic groups, sexes, and individuals come not from differences in their innate constitution but from differences in their experiences. Change the experiences&#x2014;by reforming parenting, education, the media, and social rewards&#x2014;and you can change the person. Underachievement, poverty, and antisocial behavior can be ameliorated; indeed, it is irresponsible not to do so. And discrimination on the basis of purportedly inborn traits of a sex or ethnic group is simply irrational.</p><p>The Blank Slate is often accompanied by two other doctrines, which have also attained a sacred status in modern intellectual life. My label for the first of the two is commonly attributed to the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), though it really comes from John Dryden's The Conquest of Granada, published in 1670:</p><p>I am as free as Nature first made man,<br><br>Ere the base laws of servitude began,<br><br>When wild in woods the noble savage ran.</p><p>The concept of the noble savage was inspired by European colonists' discovery of indigenous peoples in the Americas, Africa, and (later) Oceania. It captures the belief that humans in their natural state are selfless, peaceable, and untroubled, and that blights such as greed, anxiety, and violence are the products of civilization. In 1755 Rousseau wrote:</p><p>So many authors have hastily concluded that man is naturally cruel, and requires a regular system of police to be reclaimed; whereas nothing can be more gentle than him in his primitive state, when placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the pernicious good sense of civilized man. . . .</p><p>The more we reflect on this state, the more convinced we shall be that it was the least subject of any to revolutions, the best for man, and that nothing could have drawn him out of it but some fatal accident, which, for the public good, should never have happened. The example of the savages, most of whom have been found in this condition, seems to confirm that mankind was formed ever to remain in it, that this condition is the real youth of the world, and that all ulterior improvements have been so many steps, in appearance towards the perfection of individuals, but in fact towards the decrepitness of the species.</p><p>First among the authors that Rousseau had in mind was Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), who had presented a very different picture:</p><p>Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man. . . .</p><p>In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.</p><p>Hobbes believed that people could escape this hellish existence only by surrendering their autonomy to a sovereign person or assembly. He called it a leviathan, the Hebrew word for a monstrous sea creature subdued by Yahweh at the dawn of creation.</p><p>Much depends on which of these armchair anthropologists is correct. If people are noble savages, then a domineering leviathan is unnecessary. Indeed, by forcing people to delineate private property for the state to recognize&#x2014;property they might otherwise have shared&#x2014;the leviathan creates the very greed and belligerence it is designed to control. A happy society would be our birthright; all we would need to do is eliminate the institutional barriers that keep it from us. If, in contrast, people are naturally nasty, the best we can hope for is an uneasy truce enforced by police and the army. The two theories have implications for private life as well. Every child is born a savage (that is, uncivilized), so if savages are naturally gentle, childrearing is a matter of providing children with opportunities to develop their potential, and evil people are products of a society that has corrupted them. If savages are naturally nasty, then childrearing is an arena of discipline and conflict, and evil people are showing a dark side that was insufficiently tamed.</p><p>The actual writings of philosophers are always more complex than the theories they come to symbolize in the textbooks. In reality, the views of Hobbes and Rousseau are not that far apart. Rousseau, like Hobbes, believed (incorrectly) that savages were solitary, without ties of love or loyalty, and without any industry or art (and he may have out-Hobbes'd Hobbes in claiming they did not even have language). Hobbes envisioned&#x2014;indeed, literally drew&#x2014;his leviathan as an embodiment of the collective will, which was vested in it by a kind of social contract; Rousseau's most famous work is called <b>The Social Contract</b>, and in it he calls on people to subordinate their interests to a "general will."</p><p>Nonetheless, Hobbes and Rousseau limned contrasting pictures of the state of nature that have inspired thinkers in the centuries since. No one can fail to recognize the influence of the doctrine of the Noble Savage in contemporary consciousness. We see it in the current respect for all things natural (natural foods, natural medicines, natural childbirth) and the distrust of the man-made, the unfashionability of authoritarian styles of childrearing and education, and the understanding of social problems as repairable defects in our institutions rather than as tragedies inherent to the human condition.</p><p>The other sacred doctrine that often accompanies the Blank Slate is usually attributed ...</p></p><h2>The Whales&#39; Song</h2><p>SOFT COVER</p><p>In this haunting, evocative picture book, Lilly's grandmother tells her that, when she was young, she used to leave gifts for the whales--"a perfect shell. Or a beautiful stone. And if they liked you, the whales would take your gift and give you something in return." Lilly's great-uncle Frederick claims that the story is "nothing but a silly old tale," that she shouldn't "be dreaming her life away." But one morning, Lilly, believing her grandmother's claim that "they were the most wondrous creatures you could ever imagine," drops a yellow flower into the water. " 'This is for you,' she called into the air," and later that night she sits waiting, like a mermaid on a rock, finally receiving a gift in return. Filling the night with their song, the whales call Lilly's name. Infused with the cadences of real speech, Sheldon's poetic text manages to overlay a homespun practicality with an ethereal, fairy-tale magic. The unique grandeur and beauty of these creatures, "as peaceful as the moon," are compellingly interwoven throughout the narrative. Newcomer Blythe's paintings are extraordinary. The play of light and shadow in his cozy interiors is delicately balanced against stunningly realistic faces--Lilly's purity and innocence, her elders' splendidly craggy countenances. Rendered in unusual perspectives, these vibrant panoramas of the sea and of the whales leaping from the moonlit water possess a rare luminosity and beauty that should not be missed. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lilly's grandmother tells her about whales: ``...big as the hills...peaceful as the moon...wondrous...'' When they were more numerous, she used go to the pier to hear them sing--perhaps in response to her gifts: a perfect shell or stone. Curmudgeonly Great-uncle Frederick counters such fantasies: ``Whales were important for their meat, and for their...blubber.'' Still, Lilly dreams of whales, then throws them a single blossom from the pier. After a long day's wait, she is rewarded by seeing whales jump against the moon while ``their singing filled the night.'' In a spare, poetic narrative, Sheldon captures a child's wonder at these magnificent creatures, echoed, in a splendid debut, in Blythe's generously broad oil paintings. His whales- -viewed from near, unusual vantage points--are benignly heroic while, from dawn to moonlight, his sea and sky are beautifully observed; best are his lovely, perceptive portraits of the old woman's wise, lined face and Lilly's tousled curls and expressive eyes.

The Spanish Crown and the Catholic Church both sought expansion in Mexico&#x2014;the former in search of gold, the latter seeking souls&#x2014;as well as entry into the mysterious land to the north called &#x201c;California.&#x201d;<br> <br>Serra&#x2019;s mission: to spread Christianity in this unknown world by building churches wherever possible and by converting the native peoples to the Word of God. It was an undertaking that seemed impossible, given the vast distances, the challenges of the unforgiving landscape, and the danger posed by resistant native tribes. Such a journey would require bottomless physical stamina, indomitable psychic strength, and, above all, the deepest faith. Serra, a diminutive man with a stout heart, possessed all of these attributes, as well as an innate humility that allowed him to see the humanity in native people whom the West viewed as savages.<br> <br>By his death at age seventy-one, Serra had traveled more than 14,000 miles on land and sea through the New World&#x2014;much of that distance on a chronically infected and painful foot&#x2014;baptized and confirmed 6,000 Indians, and founded nine of California&#x2019;s twenty-one missions, with his followers establishing the rest. The names of these missions ring through the history of California&#x2014; San Diego, San Jose, San Juan Capistrano, Santa Clara, and San Francisco&#x2014;and served as the epicenters of the arrival of Western civilization, where millions more would follow, creating the California we know today.<br> <br>An impoverished son, an inspired priest, and a potent political force, Serra was a complex man who stood at the historic crossroads between Native Americans, the often brutal Spanish soldiers, and the dictates of the Catholic Church, which still practiced punishment by flogging. In this uncertain, violent atmosphere, Serra sought to protect the indigenous peoples from abuse and to bring them the rituals and spiritual comfort of the Church even as the microbes carried by Europeans threatened their existence.<br> <br>Beginning with Serra&#x2019;s boyhood on the isolated island of Mallorca, venturing into the final days of the Spanish Inquisition, revealing the thriving grandeur of Mexico City, and finally journeying up the untouched California coast, Gregory Orfalea&#x2019;s magisterial biography is a rich epic that cuts new ground in our understanding of the origins of the United States.<br> <br>Combining biography, European history, knowledge of Catholic doctrine, and anthropology, <i>Journey to the Sun</i> brings original research and perspective to America&#x2019;s creation story. Orfalea&#x2019;s poetic and incisive recounting of Serra&#x2019;s life shows how one man changed the future of California and in so doing affected the future of our nation.</p><p>Gregory Orfalea was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and educated at Georgetown University and the University of Alaska. He has held teaching positions at Georgetown, The Claremont Colleges, and at Westmont College. Orfalea is the author and editor of eight books, the most recent of which are the short story collection <i>The Man Who Guarded the Bomb</i> and <i>Angeleno Days</i>, which won the 2010 Arab American Book Award and has been named a Finalist for the PEN USA Award in Creative Nonfiction."A popular, highly readable history of an important figure...Orfalea's book is polished and professional."

Approximately 120 color and 20 black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>One should not commit the injustice of calling this an exhibition catalog, because it stands so well apart from the splendid traveling collection it accompanies. This is a book of wonders in many respects. The essays illuminate selected corners of O'Keeffe's life and art. The letters, full of vivacity, keen insight, and hard thinking, show how she saw her life and chose to live. Above all are the brilliantly reproduced paintings; easily seen as sensual, they are also tightly controlled visions of color and form, monumental and deeply intellectual. It is far too easy to make O'Keeffe a cultural icon instead of seeing her as one of the America's two or three greatest artists. This book argues the latter with sweet force. GraceAnne A.

Andrade, an editor of Vietnam magazine, explains why their efforts were crucial to the outcome of the 1972 battles in Quang Tri Province, the Central Highlands and during the siege of An Loc. Most noteworthy is his detailed assessment of John Paul Vann's advisory leadership during the battle for Kontum and his diplomatic dealings with uncooperative troops from the Republic of (South) Korea. (Vann is the protagonist in Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie.) The motivations behind the massive offensive, according to the author's reckoning, were many: the Communists hoped to influence the 1972 U.S. presidential election, upset the tempo of Nixon's Vietnamization program, reverse the advances of Saigon's pacification efforts and hasten the total pullout of American troops. The defeat of the North Vietnamese in the Easter Offensive was only a temporary setback but marked the end of General Vo Nguyen Giap's distinguished career. Andrade argues that Giap's biggest mistake was to attack on three fronts instead of concentrating on a single devastating thrust. Essential reading for the serious student of war, the book is a major case study of command and control on the battlefield. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Storm Riders (Dragon Brigade Series)</h2><p><p>In a world where magic is intrinsic to the fabric of everyday life, two kingdoms, centuries-long enemies, have long sought a powerful magical weapon that will win them lasting dominance.

If bored, the audience may walk out, choosing their own ending.</i> <br>&#x2014;Sir Walter Maidstone, Freyan playwright <br>In the bedchamber upstairs in the elegant house in Freya&#x2019;s capital city of Haever, the child of Sir Henry Wallace was coming into the world. Sir Henry was downstairs in his study, listening in agony to his young wife&#x2019;s moans and screams. Sir Henry sat and paced and sat again and paced again, alternately cursing God or praying to Him. For the first time in Sir Henry&#x2019;s long, illustrious and, many would say, infamous life, he was helpless. <br>He had done all he could. He had hired the best physicians, healers, nurses, and midwives, including the physician who attended to Her Majesty, Queen Mary of Freya. His wife&#x2019;s bedchamber and the long hallway outside were crowded with illustrious medical practitioners, midwives, and healers, who got into heated arguments with the physicians over the best course of treatment. But as one of the midwives said with a shrug, &#x201c;Babies will come as babies will come and there&#x2019;s only so much a body can do.&#x201d; <br>His wife&#x2019;s labor had been so long and difficult that Sir Henry, appalled at the terrible sounds emanating from her bedchamber, had already once attempted to force his way through the door. The physicians and midwives, healers and nurses had united to wrestle him out of the room. Expectant fathers were considered a nuisance, if not a downright menace. <br>Sir Henry, the most powerful man in the kingdom of Freya, was forced to retreat, taking refuge in his study. He tried to read a recently published book, an account of the Blackfire War written by an eminent Freyan historian, but when he realized he&#x2019;d read the same paragraph six times, he tossed the book to the floor. <br>Going to the window, he stood staring moodily into the street. The summer evening was gentle and warm; he shed his coat and threw off his cravat. The mists of the Breath on the distant horizon were fading shades of delicate pink and orange. As night&#x2019;s shadows closed in, lights gleamed in the windows of the city homes of the Freyan noble lords. <br>The lamplighter would be coming soon, Sir Henry thought. A particularly loud scream caused him to shudder and break out in a cold sweat. <br>Preoccupied with his fears and hopes, he paid only scant attention to the wyvern-drawn carriage rapidly descending from the twilight sky to land on the street outside the house. Sir Henry assumed this was yet another doctor. He was about to turn away when he caught sight of a tall, heavily cloaked yet extremely familiar figure descending from the carriage. <br>Sir Henry uttered an exclamation of joy. He left his study in his shirtsleeves and went to the door himself, nearly colliding with the shocked footman who was supposed to attend to such duties. <br>Sir Henry yanked open the door, startling Mr. Sloan, who had his hand on the bell. <br>&#x201c;Come in, Franklin, come in,&#x201d; said Sir Henry, quite forgetting himself and addressing Mr. Sloan by his given name. He took hold of Mr. Sloan&#x2019;s hand and gripped it tightly. &#x201c;It is good to see you.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan was taken aback and much affected by his master&#x2019;s unusual warmth. Flushing slightly, he murmured that he hoped he found Sir Henry well. <br>Sir Henry recovered himself and stepped back to allow the footman to remove Mr. Sloan&#x2019;s cloak and hat and take them away. Mr. Sloan, with a worried glance, indicated his concern at the number of carriages parked in the street, many decorated with the coats-of-arms of well-known physicians or healers. <br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan, &#x201c;is everything&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The child is coming,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. <br>Another moaning cry from upstairs proclaimed the truth of this statement. <br>Mr. Sloan did the unthinkable. He clasped Sir Henry&#x2019;s hand as fellow man to fellow man, not as secretary to his employer, and pressed the cold hand in warm sympathy. <br>&#x201c;I will pray to God for your lady wife and the child, my lord.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Sloan,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. He turned away, cleared his throat, and then said in his usual formal tone, &#x201c;Have you dined?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. &#x201c;I came straight from the ship. Captain Northrop sends his regards, by the way.&#x201d; <br>Hearing another cry, Mr. Sloan hesitated. &#x201c;If this is not a good time, my lord, I can return&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. &#x201c;I need something to distract me. I have not dined either. I fear I cannot offer you a proper meal. The doctors have the kitchen staff boiling water and doing God knows what else.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A bite standing is all I require, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. <br>&#x201c;I believe we can do better than that,&#x201d; said Sir Henry with a faint smile. <br>He rang a bell and gave instructions to bring a collation of cold meats and cheeses, bread, nuts, and fruit, a bottle of wine for himself, and a pitcher of ale for Mr. Sloan, whose strict religious views permitted the consumption of ale, but not wine. <br>The two men retired to the study, where they did justice to the food and then settled down to discuss Mr. Sloan&#x2019;s recent trip to the city-state of Braffa, and the momentous events that had occurred in Mr. Sloan&#x2019;s absence. <br>&#x201c;I was not expecting you for another week, Mr. Sloan,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. &#x201c;I judge by your hasty return that you have important news.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed I do, my lord. King Alaric has withdrawn the Rosian fleet from Braffa.&#x201d; <br>Sir Henry was in the act of raising a glass of port to his lips. He stopped midway to stare, then set the glass down untasted. <br>&#x201c;The devil he has! What has he done with the ships?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ordered them back to Rosia.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s terrified because of the attack on Westfirth,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. <br>&#x201c;So one would assume, my lord. Have you received any information from your agents in Rosia?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not a word. Few ship captains have been either brave or foolhardy enough to venture out into the Breath since the attack on Westfirth. I can&#x2019;t say I blame them. I saw King Alaric&#x2019;s pride, the <i>Royal Lion,</i> explode and sink in flames&#x2014;a terrible sight, Mr. Sloan. The enemy fired only a single shot&#x2014;a green beam of contramagic from a cannon the size of a popgun. And yet it sank a sixty-gun warship.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan appeared suitably impressed. <br>Sir Henry sighed. &#x201c;I suppose I should have celebrated the Rosian defeat, but I could not bring myself to do so.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. &#x201c;Understandable. I myself saw those demonic creatures when they attacked your manor house. Do you fear Freya is next?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what I fear, and that makes me even more afraid,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. &#x201c;By the way, I did not at first give credence to your account of the bat-riding demons. My apologies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None required, my lord. I found it difficult to believe my own eyes,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. <br>He sat forward in his chair and, despite the fact that the study was heavily protected by magical constructs that dampened the sound, he lowered his voice. &#x201c;You mentioned a beam of green light. I am reminded, my lord, of the cutter <i>Defiant,</i> and a certain woman&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eiddwen. Yes,&#x201d; said Sir Henry, his face darkening. &#x201c;She is involved, of that I am certain. She tried to have me assassinated in Westfirth, just prior to the attack.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good God, my lord!&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan, shocked into blasphemy. &#x201c;You were not hurt&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I escaped unscathed and, as it turned out, I gained some immensely valuable information. Eiddwen laid an ambush for me and my old nemesis, Father Jacob Northrop. We were attacked by demons in an alley. Father Jacob saved my life.&#x201d; Sir Henry gave a grim smile. &#x201c;And I saved Eiddwen&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My lord?&#x201d; Mr. Sloan was bewildered. <br>&#x201c;Not of my volition, believe me,&#x201d; Sir Henry said drily. &#x201c;She disguised herself as a sailor and stowed away on the merchant ship I had hired to smuggle myself and the journeyman, Alcazar, out of Westfirth. Eiddwen either knew the demons were going to attack Westfirth or she was the one who ordered the attack. She needed to leave before she was caught in the assault.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You are certain she is connected to these fiends?&#x201d; Mr. Sloan asked. <br>&#x201c;I am. She used the demons to try to kill me, first in my own house and, failing that, in Westfirth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If so, my lord, that means&#x2026;&#x201d; Mr. Sloan paused. <br>&#x201c;That means that whoever these people are, <i>I</i> helped fund their infernal green beam contramagic weapons,&#x201d; said Sir Henry with some bitterness. <br>&#x201c;You speak of them as people. I assume you do not believe the fiends are minions of the Evil One, my lord?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I saw one of them shot dead, Mr. Sloan. I think it likely a true demon of hell would be able to withstand a mere bullet.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;An excellent point, my lord.&#x201d; Mr. Sloan appeared relieved. &#x201c;What about Mistress Eiddwen? You speak of her in the present tense. I gather you let her live.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I had no choice,&#x201d; said Sir Henry with a grim smile. &#x201c;Much as I would have liked to have wrung her lovely neck, there were too many witnesses on board the ship. She had chosen the battleground. That made me cautious. We drank a toast to our mutual destruction.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So what did you do with her, my lord?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing I could do, Mr. Sloan, except deliver her to some godforsaken place on the Rosian coast. She disembarked, and that was the last I have seen or heard of the woman. I did tell her that if she ever attacked me or my family again I would track her to the hell where she was spawned, chain her to the devil&#x2019;s gridiron, and pour boiling oil on her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What was her reply to that, my lord?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She laughed. She said that her reason for trying to kill me had been merely to tie up a loose end, and that events had been set in motion that I could not stop.&#x201d; <br>Sir Henry finished the port. Rising to his feet, he walked to the door, opened it, listened, shook his head, slammed the door, walked back to the table, and sat down. He poured another glass of port for himself, but did not drink. He merely sat, brooding, and gazed at the carpet. <br>Mr. Sloan thought it expedient to turn his master&#x2019;s thoughts to a more pleasant topic. <br>&#x201c;How is Alcazar progressing with his invention, my lord?&#x201d; <br>Sir Henry looked up with a smile. &#x201c;Quite well, Mr. Sloan. He has produced a vast quantity of the magically enhanced steel. Tests have proven that the magical constructs he placed on the pewter tankard work even better on steel, as he theorized. A cannonball fired directly at a plate of the magically enhanced steel bounced off, leaving scarcely a dent.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excellent news, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. <br>&#x201c;And I made an important discovery, Mr. Sloan,&#x201d; said Sir Henry. &#x201c;This is news I have shared with no one, not even Alcazar. Or should I say <i>especially</i> not Alcazar&#x2014;the man leaks like a punctured balloon. Alcazar&#x2019;s steel not only deflects bullets and cannonballs.&#x201d; Sir Henry paused for dramatic effect, lowering his voice. &#x201c;The steel deflects the demonic green beam weapon&#x2019;s fire.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;How did you make this discovery, my lord?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know that I carried that blasted tankard with me in a leather satchel the entire time I was in Rosia. When Eiddwen&#x2019;s demons shot their green fireballs from their long guns at me, I flung the satchel up to guard my face. The contramagic fire hit the satchel. The leather disintegrated. The tankard inside was untouched. As was I, fortunately.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God be thanked, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan in solemn tones. <br>&#x201c;I did thank Him, Mr. Sloan. Of that you may be certain. I have set Alcazar and his workers the task of manufacturing large plates made of this magical metal, which I will have installed on a gunboat. Given your news, it appears I may be making a journey soon to Braffa. If I encounter any of the demons along the way, I should be protected.&#x201d; <br>Sir Henry raised his glass. &#x201c;Let us drink to the confusion of our enemies, be they demons or Rosians.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan took a sip of his ale, and Sir Henry downed his entire glass of port. Another scream came from upstairs. Sir Henry swore under his breath and mopped his head with a handkerchief. Mr. Sloan rose quietly to pour his master another glass of port. Sir Henry thanked him with a look, accepted the glass, and resumed their conversation. <br>&#x201c;I have one concern, Mr. Sloan.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan might well have said, &#x201c;Only one, my lord?&#x201d; Instead, he merely inclined his head to indicate that he was listening attentively. <br>&#x201c;A brief preface to this tale. When I was in Westfirth, I discovered the son of my Rosian counterpart, the Countess de Marjolaine, had found out about Alcazar and his invention and was trying to prevent Alcazar and me from escaping to Freya. Captain de Guichen is a gallant soldier, but he lacks his mother&#x2019;s skill at intrigue. I was able to not only give him the slip in Westfirth, but to take his best friend, one Monsieur Rodrigo de Villeneuve, hostage to ensure my safety. I took Monsieur de Villeneuve on board my ship, letting Captain de Guichen know that I would most certainly kill his friend if he attempted to stop me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What became of the captain, my lord?&#x201d; Mr. Sloan asked, concerned. &#x201c;I trust he is not still pursuing you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Mr. Sloan, Captain de Guichen and his friends are currently languishing on a remote island in the Breath, thanks to a cannonball fired from Admiral Baker&#x2019;s warship. The captain is not what concerns me. During the voyage on the <i>Raven,</i> Alcazar and Monsieur de Villeneuve discussed the magically enhanced steel. I paid no heed to their blathering, for they were going on about theorems and postulates and whatnot. Unfortunately, their discussion occurred before I knew Eiddwen was on board. I think it most likely she eavesdropped on them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That <i>is</i> unfortunate, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan. &#x201c;Do you know whether she overheard anything about this new steel?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I fear so. The two idiots were talking openly of contramagic in regard to the magical steel. I ordered them to shut up, but she would have undoubtedly found their conversation most interesting.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan shook his head. &#x201c;Most disturbing, my lord.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed. I had not mentioned to Alcazar or anyone the fact that the steel is resistant to contramagic. Although I have no doubt the clever Monsieur de Villeneuve will soon arrive at that conclusion.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why do you say that, my lord?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because when we parted and I sent him off to join his shipmates on their deserted island, I gave Monsieur de Villeneuve the pewter tankard as a gift for my old enemy, the Countess de Marjolaine.&#x201d; <br>Mr. Sloan was in the act of drinking ale when he received this startling news. He swallowed the wrong way, choked, and spent several moments coughing into his handkerchief. <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, Mr. Sloan. I should have waited until you had finished.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Please give the matter no thought, my lord,&#x201d; said Mr. Sloan when he could speak. &#x201c;If I could inquire as to why you would&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;give an immensely important military discovery to our enemies?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I am certain you have good reason.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I do, Mr. Sloan.&#x201d; <br>Sir Henry rested his elbows on the arms of the chair, brought the tips of his fingers together, and placed his two forefingers on his narrow chin. He gazed in silence into the empty grate for long moments while Mr. Sloan sat quietly, waiting. <br>&#x201c;The demons attacked a stone guard tower not twenty miles from where we are sitting, Mr. Sloan. When you and I inspected the site, we saw how the magical constructs that strengthened the stones had been completely erased. That attack on Freyan soil was both a test and a taunt. The attack on our Rosian enemies in Westfirth was the same. As Eiddwen said, events have been set in motion. These fiends are letting both nations know that they are coming and there is not a damn thing we can do to stop them.&#x201d;</p><h2>The World of Christopher Marlowe</h2><p>The definitive biography: a masterly account of Marlowe's work and life and the world in which he lived<br><br>Shakespeare's contemporary, Christopher Marlowe revolutionized English drama and poetry, transforming the Elizabethan stage into a place of astonishing creativity. The outline of Marlowe's life, work, and violent death are known, but few of the details that explain why his writing and ideas made him such a provocateur in the Elizabethan era have been available until now. In this absorbing consideration of Marlowe and his times, David Riggs presents Marlowe as the language's first poetic dramatist whose desires proved his undoing. <br><br>In an age of tremendous cultural change in Europe when Cervantes wrote the first novel and Copernicus demonstrated a world subservient to other nonreligious forces, Catholics and Protestants battled for control of England and Elizabeth's crown was anything but secure. Into this whirlwind of change stepped Marlowe espousing sexual freedom and atheism. His beliefs proved too dangerous to those in power and he was condemned as a spy and later murdered. Riggs's exhaustive research digs deeply into the mystery of how and why Marlowe was killed.<br></p><p>David Riggs is a professor of English at Stanford University. His previous books include <i>Ben Jonson: A Life.</i> He lectures regularly at leading universities in the United States and Great Britain, and has written articles for <i>The Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies</i> and <i>Shakespeare Quarterly</i>, among others. He lives in Stanford, California.<br>William Shakespeare, according to Keats, possessed "negative capability," that is, he was able to become so fully each of his characters that his own personality remains permanently elusive. As a result, we can never quite picture the creator of "Hamlet," "Henry IV" and "As You Like It": He contains multitudes, though he probably thought of himself as just another hard-working theater professional, a businessman of letters.<p> Biographical information about Shakespeare is frustratingly sparse, and no more plentiful for his great contemporary Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), stabbed to death at age 29 in an argument over a tavern bill. But where Shakespeare is everyone and no one, Marlowe has passed into history as the most glamorous figure of England's literary Renaissance. Read his plays, and their melodramatic heroes -- the wizard Dr. Faustus, the conqueror Tamburlaine, the homosexual Edward II, the duplicitous Barabas -- might all be played by their flamboyant, youthful creator.</p><p>For in his time, and ever since, Marlowe has been viewed as the epitome of the intellectual over-reacher -- "I count religion but a childish toy,/ And hold there is no sin but ignorance." So says Barabas in "The Jew of Malta," but voicing what seems Marlowe's own opinions. Born in Canterbury, the young man first soaked up learning as a poor scholarship student at Cambridge, then became a translator, poet, playwright, atheist, sodomite, streetfighter, counterfeiter, spy and finally a man who knew too much for his own good. One afternoon Robert Poley, Ingram Frizer and Nicholas Skerres -- their very names are sinister -- enticed him to the Widow Bull's in Deptford, where they all ate and drank, then quarreled over "the reckoning." A struggle ensued, only to stop when Marlowe's own dagger, with his hand still around its hilt, was driven back through his right eye deep into his brain. Was it a contract killing, as many scholars now believe? "Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight." Christopher Marlowe's life was suddenly over; his legend had just begun.</p><p>From the very first, "Kind Kit" Marlowe inspired deep emotions, affection from fellow writers like Thomas Nashe (who worked with him on "The Jew of Malta") and Thomas Kyd (his sometime roommate and the likely author of an early play about Hamlet, as well as "The Spanish Tragedy") but also envy, animosity and hatred. Yet even when his enemies attacked this upstart, they somehow portrayed him as insidiously attractive, an Elizabethan Rimbaud or Jim Morrison. His former school chum Gabriel Harvey tut-tutted that he neither "feared God, nor dreaded Div'll,/ Nor ought admired, but his wondrous selfe." Thomas Warton asserted that his translation of Ovid's Amores conveyed "the obscenities of the brothel in elegant language." (Quite true: In one love poem Marlowe boldly writes, "Lo, I confess, I am thy captive I,/ And hold my conquer'd hands for thee to tie"; another takes up sexual impotence.) It seems appropriate that this same genius should also have composed the most limpidly beautiful lyric of the age, "Come live with me, and be my love."</p><p>According to C.S. Lewis, in a memorable summation, Marlowe is "our great master of the material imagination; he writes best about flesh, gold, gems, stone, fire, clothes, water, snow, and air." Certainly, his one long poem, "Hero and Leander," portrays a delicious holiday-world, where beauty and sensuality are one. As Leander reminds the virginal Hero, acolyte of Venus:</p><p>. . . . The rites<br>In which love's beauteous empress most delights,<br>Are banquets, Doric music, midnight revel,<br>Plays, masques, and all that stern age counteth evil.</p><p>Many readers will recognize this poem's most famous couplet: "Where both deliberate, the love is slight;/ Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?" Yet this "erotic epyllion" shimmers with sensuous passages, like this provocative description of Hero and Leander making love: "She trembling strove; this strife of hers (like that/ Which made the world) another world begat/ Of unknown joy." As always with Marlowe, he is particularly good at depicting the power of youthful male beauty. Of Leander he concludes that "Jove might have sipp'd out nectar from his hand" while he later describes a beautiful shepherd boy who "of the cooling river durst not drink,/ Lest water-nymphs should pull him from the brink."</p><p>Something of this elegant love-banter continues in the earliest of Marlowe's dramas, "Dido and Aeneas." Not as admired as his later tragedies, it is nonetheless a kind of stately opera in prose (and one that occasionally recalls Purcell's musical masterpiece of the same title). Consider any of Dido's last pleading speeches before Aeneas abandons her to sail for Rome. The heroine's sentiments are universal, and echo modern Country-and-Western heartbreakers as much as Vergil:</p><p>Why look'st thou toward the sea? The time hath been<br>When Dido's beauty chain'd thine eyes to her.<br>Am I less fair than when thou saw'st me first?<br>Oh, then, Aeneas, 'tis for grief of thee!<br>Say thou wilt stay in Carthage with thy queen,<br>And Dido's beauty will return again.</p><p>Marlowe's most celebrated play is doubtless "Dr. Faustus" -- the story of the scholar who sells his soul to the devil and then doesn't quite know what to do with the power and knowledge he acquires. Naturally, Mephistopheles diverts his victim with sexual romps:</p><p>Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;<br>And if thou lovest me, think no more of it.<br>I'll cull thee out the fairest courtesans,<br>And bring them ev'ry morning to thy bed:<br>She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,<br>Were she as chaste as was Penelope,<br>As wise as Sava, or as beautiful<br>As was bright Lucifer before his fall.</p><p>Note, however, the unexpected shift to male beauty in the last line, the same kind of slither that takes place in the latter part of the gorgeous soliloquy about Helen of Troy ("Was this the face that launched a thousand ships?"):</p><p>O, thou art fairer than the evening's air<br>Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;<br>Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter<br>When he appear'd to hapless Semele;<br>More lovely than the monarch of the sky<br>In wanton Arethusa's azured arms;<br>And none but thou shalt be my paramour.</p><p>Some have held that "Edward II" -- about that king's passion for his minion Gaveston -- is a better-made play than "Dr. Faustus"; certainly its scene of Edward's murder -- with hints of violation with a red-hot poker -- make for horrifying and powerful theater. To my mind, "The Jew of Malta" might well be regarded as Marlowe's meditation on espionage, since Barabas practices all the skills of the spy and the double agent. It is also a play that Shakespeare must have seen, for at one point the merchant exclaims: "But stay: What star shines yonder in the east?/ The loadstar of my life, if Abigail." In our own time, the play's most famous exchange provided T.S. Eliot with an epigraph: "Thou hast committed -- / Fornication; but that was in another country;/ And besides, the wench is dead."</p><p>Great as all these works are, for Elizabethans Christopher Marlowe was above all the dramatist of "Tamburlaine," the shepherd turned conqueror, the wind from the east, the Scourge of God:</p><p>I hold the Fates bound in iron chains,<br>And with my hand turn Fortune's wheel about<br>And sooner shall the sun fall from his sphere<br>Than Tamburlaine be slain or overcome.</p><p>This vast two-part historical drama established blank verse -- what Ben Jonson called "Marlowe's mighty line" -- as a medium for drama, and related its hero's whirlwind career with subtlety and feeling. Tamburlaine may rant, but he can also express himself in exquisite poetry, as when the dread warrior rejects a last-minute plea for mercy:</p><p>I will not spare these proud Egyptians,<br>Nor change my martial observations<br>For all the wealth of Gihon's golden waves, <br>Or for the love of Venus, would she leave<br>The angry god of arms and lie with me.<br>They have refused the offer of their lives,<br>And know my customs are as peremptory<br>As wrathful planets, death, or destiny.</p><p>Discoveries about Kit Marlowe have produced some of the most exciting works of 20th-century literary scholarship: Leslie Hotson's ground-breaking The Death of Christopher Marlowe; John Bakeless's capacious two-volume Tragical History of Christopher Marlowe (chockablock with documentation); and, not least, Charles Nicholl's award-winning recreation of the shadow-realm of Elizabethan espionage, The Reckoning. To this company we must now add David Riggs's The World of Christopher Marlowe, the best one-volume introduction to its subject's life and times. As his title suggests, Riggs supplements our paltry factual knowledge about Marlowe by describing his various milieux: Canterbury and Cambridge, the London theater scene, the world of religious and intellectual iconoclasm and, finally, the dark realm of terrorist plots and political assassination. It is a good and reliable book.</p><p>But it lacks the sheer excitement of the earlier works just mentioned, as it does the pleasure of two fine novels based on Marlowe's life: George Garrett's Entered by the Sun and Anthony Burgess's A Dead Man in Deptford. Still, Christopher Marlowe is one of those figures about whom one wants to read everything written, and Riggs's book is now the best starting place -- if we exclude the dramas and poems of Marlowe himself, "infinite riches in a little room." Now, if only some scholar would discover the texts of Marlowe's two lost and suggestively titled plays, "The Maiden's Holiday" and "Lust's Dominion." </p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Their perennial bestseller, How to Be Your Dog&#x2019;s Best Friend, is considered a classic in the dog-training field. First published in 1978, and completely revised and updated in 2002, the book has brought the Monks international acclaim for their successful mixture of discipline and love. Their second book, The Art of Raising a Puppy, was also a bestseller. Together, the two titles have sold close to one million copies. <p>Now, the Monks of New Skete reflect on the amazing bond that dogs and their owners share in the lavishly illustrated gift book, I &amp; DOG. Celebrating this special relationship through words and images, the Monks offer a simple message: we could do worse than to learn from dogs &#x2013; about ourselves, about our spirituality, and about God. </p><p>Taking readers on an eloquent exploration of the profound attachment between human and dog, this 80-page hardcover book features inspirational passages from the Monks of New Skete combined with more than fifty spectacular black and white and color images taken by talented photographers John Sann and Monique Stauder. Distilling all the wisdom and insight that the Monks have gained over the years living with and training these special creatures, this beautiful book pays homage to our extraordinary connection with our dogs. </p><p>In keeping with their philosophy, the Monks stress that love grows through respect, understanding and nurturing, and that it is humans&#x2019; responsibility to listen and learn from our canine partners.</p></p><p>Here is a sampling of the wisdom found inside this amazing book: <p>"For many of us, love for creation deepens through the relationships we form with our pets, particularly our dogs. By their very nature and need, dogs draw us out of ourselves: they root us in nature, making us more conscious of the mystery of God inherent in all things." </p><p>"Dogs mirror us back to ourselves in unmistakable ways that, if we are open, foster true understanding and change. Dogs are guileless and filled with spontaneity: unlike people, they don&#x2019;t deceive. When we take seriously the words they speak to us about ourselves, we stand face to face with the truth of the matter. We must learn to reflect on these words&#x2014;they are inscribed on their bodies, in their expressions, in the way they approach and interact with us." </p><p>"Though it is entirely natural for us to project human motives onto dogs, ultimately this is unfair: it puts expectations on dogs that disregard their reality. Dogs wander in their own universe and resist being judged according to human standards.

Revised for publication, the lectures hold the features and style of oratory intrinsic to the Salish people in general and the Sto: lo in particular. From her Coast Salish perspective and with great eloquence, Maracle shares her knowledge of Sto: lo history, memory, philosophy, law, spirituality, feminism and the colonial condition of her people.</p><p>Powerful and inspiring, <i>Memory Serves</i> is an extremely timely book, not only because it is the first collection of oratories by one of the most important Indigenous authors in Canada, but also because it offers all Canadians, in Maracle's own words, "another way to be, to think, to know," a way that holds the promise of a "journey toward a common consciousness."</p></p><p><p>Lee Maracle is a member of the St� l&#x14d; nation. Born in Vancouver, she grew up on the North Shore. The author of many critically acclaimed novels, including <i>Sundogs, Daughters Are Forever, Ravensong</i> and <i>Celia's Song</i>, she has also published short fiction, <i>Sojourner's Truth and Other Stories</i> and <i>First Wives Club: Coast Salish Style</i>. The granddaughter of the renowned Chief Dan George, she is considered to be a "knowledge keeper" of her people's history, and was one of the founders of the En'owkin Centre, the international school of Indigenous writing in Penticton, B.C. Widely published in anthologies and scholarly journals, she is also the author of Bent Box, a poetry book, the young adult novel, Will's Garden, and the autobiographical narratives of Bobbi Lee: Indian Rebel and I Am Woman. Currently an instructor and student mentor in the Aboriginal Studies Program at the University of Toronto, as well as the Traditional Teacher for First Nations' House at Toronto's Centre for Indigenous Theatre. Maracle's writing and contributions to First Nations communities have been recognized by many awards, including the JT Stewart Award, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and the Premier's Award for Excellence in the Arts for Ontario.</p><p>Memory Serves<br><br></p><p>Memory serves. It is directed by condition, culture, and objective. It is conjured by systemic practice. It is shaped by results. By the time humans are seven years old, the commitment to remember is shaped, and they remember from the point of view of their social milieu.</p><p>In a society, which relies on a trial process, memory serves as evidence, as objective proof based on facts. Evidence and facts are collected with the intent to prove some hypothesis or thesis. This proof then becomes the basis for judgment, decision or action.</p><p>This is a simple system that fails to count humans as variable, as spirited, creative, and emotional beings. It is a simple system that fails to account for catastrophe, social and personal trauma, and how humans fall off track.</p><p>In a society, which is hierarchical, held up by armies, police, punitive deterrents and authoritarian-based respectability, the human as variable does not need to be considered. What needs to be known to humans before a decision is made is who has the authority to make it; what the law or policy governing the decision is; what the place of the author in the decision-making ladder is; and what the parameters of the author's decision-making authority are. People are expected to obey the decision or be punished for their disobedience.</p><p>The proof then returns full circle as the basis for conviction or alienation of the dissident. Memory does not exist for any other social purpose. Facts are defined as objective memory. The rememberers strive to record evidence and achieve objectivity. Recorded objective memory is embraced as the only valid memory. The realm of spiritual intent, creative motive or human emotion is relegated to subjectivity and persuasion; the art of engaging others in dialogue, embracing their emotional spiritual and intellectual sensibility, has no place.</p><p>Each witness becomes part of the argument between defense and prosecution. Justice is not a consideration. What happened, the activities of the humans, the facts surrounding the case and the law, is all that is considered.</p><p>When humans give breath to life, give voice to their perception of life, this is a sacred act. They are taking an event that has already been committed and they are re-membering or reconstructing it in their minds.</p><p>Memory serves. In a society governed first and foremost by spirit to spirit relationships to all beings, memory serves much differently than in a society in which property possession determines importance. To re-member is, first, directional. Indigenous people commit to memory those events and the aspects of those events that suit the direction we are moving in or the direction we want to move in if a shift is occurring. I choose to remember what happens to Sockeye because that is the direction from which Salish people move. We re-member events; we reconstruct them because we are aware that they have already ended, are dis-membered, gone forever, and because they affect us and are directly connected to who we are as a people. We may wish to achieve a new direction, secure an old direction, or mark the path travelled so that others may find the path easier to follow. Our memories serve the foregoing. Who or what is important does not figure into it. This is what governs our lives and shapes our oracy. Memory is also the governor of native literacy.</p><p>Creative non-fiction is bound by the original foundations handed to us by ancestors, ceremony, laws, and our relationship to creation. We place our obligations before us when we re-member. To what end do I wish to re-create this moment? What direction do I wish this memory to travel in the future? In so doing we hang on to memories of those things that assist us in conjuring and travelling in the direction charted by the culture that has shaped us. We let go those things that will impair our journey or thwart the courage required to secure our path. We determine the direction we believe we wish to travel before we speak or make a truckload of decisions. The direction we are travelling shapes our memories whether we are conscious of this or not.</p><p>Our intent governs our choice of words in recalling events. The winds are our uncles. Our cultures name them and define their relationship to us. Wind, breath, and voice are about where you want to end up, not about what happened or what facts you have assimilated to bolster your thoughts. Facts are mathematical things, quantities intended to persuade the thoughtless and the spiritless. Our direction is rooted to the imagined relationship between two or more beings from the beginning of the relationship to the end of their journey. The winds breathed life into our bodies. We share the winds, and reflect their directional qualities. It is our breath, our spirit, and our heart that are articulated when we open our mouth. Where you are going with this is the question we all recognize.</p><p><i>I love the bones that are stones. . .</i></p><p>Stone is our oldest grandfather. We refer to the stones that keep our songs and stories as grandfathers. Our grandfathers give us the rock on which we stand, but our grandmothers move us from that stone in the direction of relation with others. They are the keepers of the stories that teach us about relations; they are the flesh of our bones that are stones. <i>I carry them, willingly.</i></p></p><h2>The Last Balladeer: The Johnny Hartman Story (Volume 68) (Studies in Jazz, 68)</h2><p>Just after recording with John Coltrane in 1963, baritone singer Johnny Hartman (1923-1983) told a family member that "something special" occurred in the studio that day. He was right - the album, containing definitive readings of "Lush Life" and "My One and Only Love," resides firmly in the realm of iconic; forever enveloping listeners in the sounds of romance. In The Last Balladeer, author Gregg Akkerman skillfully reveals not only the intimate details of that album but the life-long achievements and occasional missteps of Hartman as an African-American artist dedicated to his craft.<br><br>This book carefully follows the journey of the Grammy-nominated vocalist from his big band origins with Earl Hines and Dizzy Gillespie to featured soloist in prestigious supper clubs throughout the world. Through exclusive interviews with Hartman's family and fellow musicians (including Tony Bennett, Billy Taylor, Kurt Elling, Jon Hendricks, and others), accounts from friends and associates, newly discovered recordings and studio outtakes, and in-depth research on his career and personal life, Akkerman expertly recollects the Hartman character as a gentleman, romantic, family man, and constant contributor to the jazz scene. From his international concerts in Japan, Australia, and England, to his steady presence as an American nightclub singer that spanned five decades, Hartman personifies the "last balladeer" of his kind, singing with a sentiment that captured the attention of Clint Eastwood, who brought Hartman's songs to the masses in the film The Bridges of Madison County.<br><br>In the first full-length biography and discography to chronicle the rhapsodic life and music of Johnny Hartman, the author completes a previously missing dimension of vocal-jazz history by documenting Hartman as the balladeer who crooned his way into so many hearts. Backed by impeccable research but conveyed in a conversational style, this book will interest not only musicians and scholars but any fan of the Great American Songbook and the singers who brought it to life.</p><p>To me, Hartman has grown to represent the very voice of romance in our times. The unadorned, molasses-sweet, sanguine tone of his baritone voice transcends the years to share stories of love and hope in a century he never saw and yet perfectly understood. He knew love would still fill our dreams, and hope would still keep us searching for that very love we crave. Hartman died all too young at the age of sixty, but the secrets to life were already his, and we can hear about it anytime one of his ballad recordings reaches our ears. And now you can read about it too.<b>Dr. Gregg Akkerman</b> is a relationship expert, writer, and entertainer born in the California desert.

Written as a text for Japanese craftsmen and carpenters, it includes every practical detail and explains every procedure.</p> <p>Traditional Japanese woodworking emphasizes the importance of the carpenter's tools - understanding their functions and giving them the best possible care. In fact, in ancient times in Japan, it was said that a worker 's skill could best be judged by observing his care of edged tools. This guide, therefore, devotes many pages to the use and care of tools. No step is overlooked: from explanations of the various types of tools to sharpening procedures (using the renowned Japanese sharpening stones), and including the best methods for their protection and storage.</p> <p>Building techniques are also carefully explained, with drawings and instructions for measuring, marking, cutting and carving wood. The latter part of the book explains methods for framing traditional wooden structures.</p> <p>Hideo Sato's exposition of the subject conveys a refreshing spirit of reverence for the work and for the tools - an atitude which is considered essential for the traditional Japanese craftsman.</p> <p>The book was expertly translated by the Japanese architect Koichi Paul Nii.</p></p><p></p><h2>Things That Differ</h2><p>This volume demonstrates how the dispensational method of Bible study is the only one by which the Bible makes sense.

In 1972 Hunter S. Thompson, the creator and king of Gonzo journalism, covered the US presidential campaign for Rolling Stone magazine alongside the establishment newsmen of Washington. The result is a classic piece of subversive reportage and a fantastic ride on the rollercoaster of Hunter&#39;s uniquely savage imagination. In his own words, written years before Watergate: &#39;It is Nixon himself who represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character almost every other country in the world has learned to fear and despise.&#39;</p><p>With the same drug-addled alacrity and jaundiced wit that made Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas a hilarious hit, Hunter S. Thompson turns his savage eye and gonzo heart to the repellent and seductive race for President. He deconstructs the 1972 campaigns of idealist George McGovern and political hack Richard Nixon, ending up with a political vision that is eerily prophetic. A classic!Hunter S. Thompson is incomparably the most celebrated exponent of the New Journalism. His books include Hell&#39;s Angels, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail `72 and Generation of Swine.Ralph Steadman is one of Britain&#39;s best-known cartoonists and illustrators.

Robin McKinley fans will recognize one of the worlds included-Damar, the setting of Newbery Medal winner <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and Newbery Honor Book <i>The Blue Sword</i>.</p><p>Robin McKinley has won various awards and citations for her writing, including the Newbery Medal for <i>The Hero and the Crown</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>The Blue Sword</i>. Her other books include <i>Sunshine</i>; the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Spindle's End</i>; two novel-length retellings of the fairy tale <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>Beauty and Rose Daughter</i>; and a retelling of the <i>Robin Hood</i> legend, <i>The Outlaws of Sherwood</i>. She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.<p> <br>In 1927, Peter Dickinson was born in Africa, within earshot of Victoria Falls. When he was seven, his family moved to England, where he graduated from Eton and later Cambridge.

His children's books have won great acclaim here as well as in Great Britain, where he has received both the Carnegie Medal and the Whitbread Award. </p><p> Peter lives in Hampshire, England, with his wife, Newbery Medalist Robin McKinley. </p><p></p><p></p>Each highly respected authors in their own right, husband and wife Dickinson (The Ropemaker) and McKinley (Spindle's End) collaborate for the first time on a collection of enchanting tales linked by an aquatic theme. Infused with selkie legends and Greek and Roman underworld myths, the tales possess a consistently compelling, rhythmic tone, despite the fact that the authors alternate in the tellings. Dickinson's opening "Mermaid Song" sets the tone for a tenuous relationship between those who dwell on sand and in sea; only the landsman who has listened to the stories passed down through generations can accord the sea its proper respect. McKinley's "The Sea-King's Son" builds on the traditional tale of the Sea-King's daughter who falls in love with a musician, but with a satisfying twist. Taken together, the installments also raise some thought-provoking issues. In "Mermaid Song," for instance, Pitiable Nasmith must lie in order to escape her grandfather's abusive home, while Hetta in "A Pool in the Desert" struggles with what constitutes truth. The workings of the Guardians' magic in McKinley's "Water Horse" remains mysterious, and Dickinson never entirely explains the gender-divided mythology in "Sea Serpent" but fans of myths won't mind filling in the gaps. These creative interpretations brim with suspenseful, chilling and wonderfully supernatural scenes, from Iril's daring plan to kill the murderous sea serpent to Hetta's literal leap of faith.

Tyson was a seventeen-year-old junior at an alternative school in the San Fernando Valley. He was thin, nervous, and cursed with soft features and gentle eyes that made him look like a freshman. Nothing about him suggested that Tyson was one of the most wanted felons in Los Angeles.</p><p>Tyson and his mother lived in a modest, one-story ranch house not far from his school. I was a block away, waiting for Tyson to leave. His mother had warned me he would be late. Tyson suffered from anxiety issues, and hated going to school. Two prior schools had expelled him for absenteeism and failing grades, so his mother enrolled him at the alternative school to keep him from dropping out. This was a decision she regretted.</p><p>His mother called as Tyson drove away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Cole? Are you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been here almost two hours, Ms. Connor. The sunrise was lovely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone. You can come in now.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson&#x2019;s mother worked as an office manager for a law firm in Encino. She appeared neat, trim, and ready for work when she opened the door, but carried herself with so much tension she might have been wrapped with duct tape.</p><p>I walked up the drive, and offered my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Elvis Cole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Devon Connor. Thanks so much for coming, Mr. Cole. I&#x2019;m sorry he took so long.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped into her living room, and watched her lock the door. The house smelled of pancakes and fish, and something I didn&#x2019;t place. A glowing aquarium bubbled beside a couch.</p><p>&#x201c;The new school doesn&#x2019;t mind, him being so late?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With what they charge, they should send a limo.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped herself, and closed her eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.

I&#x2019;ll show you how bad.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson&#x2019;s bedroom was small, and looked like a typical middle-class, teenage boy&#x2019;s bedroom. A dresser sat opposite a walk-in closet, an �unmade bed filled the corner, and his nightstand bristled with soda cans, chip bags, and crumbs. Special Forces operators with glowing green eyes watched us&nbsp;from a recruitment poster above the bed. A desk beneath his window was crowded with a desktop computer, a laptop, three monitors, and an impressive tangle of game controllers.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;He must be a serious gamer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t sit still in school, but he can sit in front of these things for hours.&#x201d;</p><p>She went to the desk, opened the middle side drawer, and took something from the back of it.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>This&nbsp;</i>is how bad it is.&#x201d;</p><p>She held out a watch with a bright white face, three dials, and three knobs on the rim. The distinctive Rolex crown was obvious.</p><p>&#x201c;A Rolex?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, made with eighteen-carat white gold. A watch like this sells for forty thousand dollars, new. Even used, they sell for more than twenty. He came home wearing it. I said, this is a Rolex, where&#x2019;d you get a watch like this?&#x201d;</p><p>Small nicks marred the rim and crystal, but the watch appeared otherwise perfect.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d;</p><p>She rolled her eyes, and looked disgusted.</p><p>&#x201c;A flea market, can you imagine? He says it&#x2019;s a knockoff, but I don&#x2019;t believe it. Does this look like a knockoff to you?&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed the watch closer, so I took it. The body felt heavy and substantial. The hands showed the correct time, and the second hand swept the face with silent precision, but I wasn&#x2019;t an expert.</p><p>&#x201c;Could it be a gift, and he doesn&#x2019;t want you to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who would give him a gift like this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His father? A grandparent?&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned again, and gave me the &#x2018;you&#x2019;re stupid&#x2019; eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;His father left before Tyson was born, and everyone else is dead. My son should not have this watch. He shouldn&#x2019;t have&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;this expensive, and we have to stop him before he gets himself killed or arrested.&#x201d;</p><p>We.</p><p>I tried to tone down the drama.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;re getting ahead of ourselves. If the watch is real, then he shouldn&#x2019;t have it, but this is the kind of thing a kid might lift if he saw it at a friend&#x2019;s house. You don&#x2019;t need a detective if Tyson has sticky fingers.&#x201d;</p><p>The reasonable detective offered a reasonable explanation, but she seemed disappointed.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s so much more than the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>She went to the closet, and reached inside.</p><p>&#x201c;It started with shirts. He didn&#x2019;t even bother to hide them, like with the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Shirts.&#x201d;</p><p>She came out with a sleek black sport coat trimmed with velvet lapels.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>New</i>&nbsp;shirts. Then new shoes turned up, and another new shirt, and this jacket, all from Barneys in Beverly Hills. We can&#x2019;t afford Barneys.&#x201d;</p><p>Her phone chirped with an incoming text. She checked the message, and slipped the phone back into her pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry. The school. I text when he leaves, they text when he arrives. It&#x2019;s how we keep track.&#x201d;</p><p>Alternative.</p><p>I fingered the jacket. The fabric felt soft and creamy, like very fine wool. Expensive.</p><p>I glanced up, and found her watching me. Waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Did the clothes come from the same flea market?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, this time a friend&#x2019;s father runs the wardrobe department at a studio. They get so many free clothes, Tyson can have whatever he wants.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t say anything. Devon went on without my prompting.</p><p>&#x201c;I called Barneys. This jacket? Tyson bought it. The salesman remembered because Tyson paid cash. Three thousand dollars, and Tyson paid&nbsp;<i>cash</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>She put the jacket back in the closet, and went to his bed.</p><p>&#x201c;After I found out about Barneys, I searched his room.&#x201d;</p><p>She slid a plastic storage container from under the bed. The container was filled with keyboards, Game Boy and Xbox gear, and action figures. She moved a keyboard, took out a box, and opened it. The box contained a thick roll of cash wrapped by a blue rubber band.</p><p>&#x201c;Four thousand, two hundred dollars. I counted. The first time, he had twenty-three hundred dollars. I found over seven thousand dollars here once. The amount changes.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat back and stared at her. Devon was describing an income stream.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you ask him about the money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I ask, he&#x2019;ll lie, just like he lied about the clothes and the watch. I want to know what he&#x2019;s doing and who he&#x2019;s doing it with before I confront him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can ask him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If we ask, he&#x2019;ll know I snoop, and he&#x2019;ll still lie. Don&#x2019;t detectives follow people? You could follow him and see what he does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Following someone is expensive. Asking is cheaper.&#x201d;</p><p>Her mouth pinched, and she glanced away. Worried.</p><p>&#x201c;We should discuss your fee. I have a good job, but I&#x2019;m not wealthy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. What would you like to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How much would it cost to follow him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two cars minimum, one op per car, ready to go twenty-four/seven. Call it three thousand a day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>She wet her lips, and her eyes lost focus. She was trying to figure out how to come up with the money, and all her options were bad. I had met a hundred parents like Devon, and seen the same fearful confusion in their eyes. Like people who didn&#x2019;t know how to swim, watching their children drown.</p><p>I changed the subject.</p><p>&#x201c;How long has this been going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since the beginning of school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And whatever he&#x2019;s doing, you believe he&#x2019;s doing it with students from school.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes snapped into hard focus.</p><p>&#x201c;Tyson&#x2019;s never been in trouble. Tyson&#x2019;s a sweetheart! He stayed home all the time, he never went out, he was afraid of everything, but then he started changing. He met a girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thrilled. Tyson doesn&#x2019;t meet girls. Tyson&#x2019;s afraid of girls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you met her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t tell me her name. He made friends with a boy named Alec. They go to the mall. I ask questions, but he&#x2019;s evasive and vague, or&nbsp;makes up more lies. Tyson was never like this. He never used to go to the mall, and now he&#x2019;s never home.&#x201d;</p><p>Tyson sounded like any other teenage boy, except for the parts about money and watches.</p><p>&#x201c;He met Alec at school?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so, but I checked the roster.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a slim red booklet from Tyson&#x2019;s desk. The cover was emblazoned with a soaring bird and the name of the school. Cal-Matrix Alternative Education.&nbsp;<i>Where students soar.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t find anyone named Alec or Alexander.&#x201d;</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t exactly drowning in clues.</p><p>I jiggled the watch. An authentic Rolex had serial and model numbers cut into the head behind the bracelet, or on the inner rim below the crystal. High-end fakes often had numbers, too, but fake numbers didn&#x2019;t appear in the manufacturer&#x2019;s records.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell you what. I have a friend who knows watches. She can tell us if the watch is real. She might even be able to tell us who owns it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t take it. Tyson might notice.&#x201d;</p><p>I told her about the numbers.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take off the bracelet, and copy the numbers. The watch can stay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t have to follow him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start small to keep the costs down, and see what develops. Sound good?&#x201d;</p><p>Her face brightened, and split with a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about the money and the watch she&#x2019;d found, and wondered if Tyson had hidden anything else.</p><p>&#x201c;You searched his room, but what about his car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only twice. When the car&#x2019;s home, he&#x2019;s home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you have a spare key, I&#x2019;d like it. I&#x2019;ll check his car after I call in the watch.&#x201d;</p><p>She started away for the key, then hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw on your website, The Elvis Cole Detective Agency. The website&nbsp;says your work is confidential.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning, when we find out what Tyson&#x2019;s doing, you won&#x2019;t tell the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It depends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The website doesn&#x2019;t say anything about depends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I find a human head in his trunk, I might feel the urge to report it.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled again, and turned away.</p><p>&#x201c;No human heads, Mr. Cole. Not yet.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like the way she said &#x2018;yet.&#x2019;</p><p>Devon gave me the key and watched me copy the numbers. When the bracelet was back on the watch, she put the watch in the drawer, and we left the house together.</p><p>Devon Connor drove away first. She had a long drive in bad traffic ahead, and was already late for work. Alternative schools were expensive, and so were detectives.</p><p>I started my car, but I didn&#x2019;t leave. I pictured the skinny kid with gentle eyes who looked like a freshman. I pictured him sneaking cash into his room, and hiding it under his bed. There were many ways he could have gotten the cash, but none of the ways were good.</p><p>Devon&#x2019;s pleasant, middle-class street was peaceful. No one was trying to murder her, or Tyson, or me, but this was about to change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sherri Toyoda and&nbsp;her family&nbsp;owned a watch shop in Santa Monica. The Toyodas sold moderately priced timepieces almost anyone could afford, but their restoration of antique and vintage collectibles had made them legends. Photographs of Sherri&#x2019;s parents with dignitaries, �politicians, and movie stars covered the walls. Three U.S. presidents, eleven senators, and four Supreme Court justices were among their clients.</p><p>I checked the numbers from the watch, and called her.</p><p>&#x201c;Guess who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday&#x2019;s bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>Sherri and I used to date.</p><p>&#x201c;I need help with a Rolex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help if I can, but we&#x2019;re not an authorized dealer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not shopping. This is a specific Cosmograph Daytona.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet! If you can afford a Cosmo, I might date you again.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone thinks they&#x2019;re a riot.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to know if it&#x2019;s genuine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bring it in. I can tell if it&#x2019;s real in five seconds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the watch. I have the serial and model numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have the chronometer certification that came with it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I knew what a chronometer certification was, the answer would be no. All I have are the numbers.&#x201d;</p><p>She was silent for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, listen. I can check your numbers with a friend at the corporate office. If your numbers match his numbers, the watch is authentic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so great if it&#x2019;s stolen. He&#x2019;ll want to know how I have the numbers, and why I&#x2019;m asking. Is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could be. How would he know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude. You buy a watch like this, you&#x2019;re walking around with twenty or thirty thousand dollars on your wrist. Guess what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They get stolen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or lost, so the company keeps a list of AWOL watches for their clients. If you lose your watch, you give them the numbers. If your watch turns up, they know you&#x2019;re the rightful owner, and give you a shout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning, you could find out who owns it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not necessarily. People sell watches. They give them as gifts. The company doesn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you trying to find the owner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>She thought some more.</p><p>&#x201c;I still might be able to help. Stores activate the warranty when someone buys a watch like this. The original buyer might be in the warranty files. Want me to check?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best, Sherri. Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>I read off the numbers, and lowered my phone, but I still didn&#x2019;t leave. Devon had searched Tyson&#x2019;s room, but she was his mom, and almost certainly missed something. I was a trained professional, and knew where to look. Or maybe I&#x2019;d get lucky.</p><p>I turned off my car, and walked up Devon&#x2019;s drive for the second time that morning. The side gate squealed, I passed Tyson&#x2019;s window, and let myself in through the kitchen.</p><p>The Connor residence held three bedrooms and two baths. Tyson probably wouldn&#x2019;t hide something in his mother&#x2019;s bedroom or bath, so I skipped them, and started in Tyson&#x2019;s bathroom.</p><p>Green streaks of toothpaste highlighted the sink, and the counter was forested with deodorant, mouthwash, zit cream, and all the usual bathroom items. A frazzled toothbrush and disposable razor stood sentry in a plastic X-Men cup. Tyson&#x2019;s medications were lined up beneath the mirror. The scripts bore Tyson&#x2019;s name, and were written for medicines commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, and attention deficit disorder. I found nothing out of the ordinary in the cabinets, behind the towels, or in the toilet tank.</p><p>The third bedroom was set up as an office, but Devon used it as a catch-all room. Mirrored sliders filled a wall opposite a desk, a file cabinet, and a bookcase jammed with law books, paperback thrillers, and titles like&nbsp;<i>The Unhappy Child</i>,&nbsp;<i>Coping with Fear</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Single Mother&#x2019;s Rule Book</i>. Cardboard boxes of Christmas decorations were stacked on a treadmill between the desk and a window, and the desk was heavy with bills, unread magazines, and a file devoted to Tyson&#x2019;s school. The file contained promotional brochures, articles, and another copy of the roster. I took a brochure and the roster, and moved on to Tyson&#x2019;s room.</p></p><h2>Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer--and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class</h2><p>A groundbreaking work that identifies the real culprit behind one of the great economic crimes of our time&#x2014; the growing inequality of incomes between the vast majority of Americans and the richest of the rich. <br><br>We all know that the very rich have gotten a lot richer these past few decades while most Americans haven&#x2019;t. In fact, the exorbitantly paid have continued to thrive during the current economic crisis, even as the rest of Americans have continued to fall behind. Why do the &#x201c;haveit- alls&#x201d; have so much more? And how have they managed to restructure the economy to reap the lion&#x2019;s share of the gains and shift the costs of their new economic playground downward, tearing new holes in the safety net and saddling all of us with increased debt and risk? Lots of so-called experts claim to have solved this great mystery, but no one has really gotten to the bottom of it&#x2014;until now. <br><br>In their lively and provocative <i>Winner-Take-All Politics, </i>renowned political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson demonstrate convincingly that the usual suspects&#x2014;foreign trade and financial globalization, technological changes in the workplace, increased education at the top&#x2014;are largely innocent of the charges against them. Instead, they indict an unlikely suspect and take us on an entertaining tour of the mountain of evidence against the culprit. The guilty party is American politics. Runaway inequality and the present economic crisis reflect what government has done to aid the rich and what it has not done to safeguard the interests of the middle class. The winner-take-all economy is primarily a result of winner-take-all politics. <br><br>In an innovative historical departure, Hacker and Pierson trace the rise of the winner-take-all economy back to the late 1970s when, under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, a major transformation of American politics occurred. With big business and conservative ideologues organizing themselves to undo the regulations and progressive tax policies that had helped ensure a fair distribution of economic rewards, deregulation got under way, taxes were cut for the wealthiest, and business decisively defeated labor in Washington. And this transformation continued under Reagan and the Bushes as well as under Clinton, with both parties catering to the interests of those at the very top. Hacker and Pierson&#x2019;s gripping narration of the epic battles waged during President Obama&#x2019;s first two years in office reveals an unpleasant but catalyzing truth: winner-take-all politics, while under challenge, is still very much with us. <br><br><i>Winner-Take-All Politics</i>&#x2014;part revelatory history, part political analysis, part intellectual journey&#x2014; shows how a political system that traditionally has been responsive to the interests of the middle class has been hijacked by the superrich. In doing so, it not only changes how we think about American politics, but also points the way to rebuilding a democracy that serves the interests of the many rather than just those of the wealthy few.</p><p>Jacob S.

There is an exciting discovery that immediately creates mystery. The scene has clues to pore over (increasingly, with the latest in forensic technology). Suspects are found and interrogated, their motives questioned, their alibis probed. And if the crime drama is worth its salt, there are surprises along the way&#x2014;unexpected twists and turns that hopefully lead to a satisfying explanation of the once-mysterious felony.<br><br>This book starts with a mystery every bit as puzzling as that of the typical crime drama, and far more important for the lives of Americans: Why, after a generation following World War II in which prosperity was broadly distributed up and down the income ladder, did the gains of economic growth start going mostly to those at the top? Why has the economy become more risky and unreliable for most Americans even as it has created vast riches for the well-positioned and well-off? The mystery is dramatic. The scene is strewn with clues. And yet this mystery has continued to bedevil some of the nation&#x2019;s finest economic detectives.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not as if the post-1970s transformation of our economy has gone unnoticed, of course: Even before the economic crisis that shook the nation in 2008, scores of economists and experts in allied fields, like sociology and political science, were creatively crunching the numbers and fiercely debating their meaning. Yet again and again, they have found themselves at dead ends or have missed crucial evidence. After countless arrests and interrogations, the demise of broad-based prosperity remains a frustratingly open case, unresolved even as the list of victims grows longer.<br><br>All this, we are convinced, is because a crucial suspect has largely escaped careful scrutiny: American politics. Understandably, investigators seeking to explain a set of economic events have sought out economic suspects. But the economic suspects, for the most part, have strong alibis. They were not around at the right time. Or they were in a lot of countries, doing just the same thing that they did in the United States, but without creating an American-style winner-take-all economy.<br><br>This chapter is not the place to pin the case on American politics&#x2014;or spell out exactly <i>how</i> American politics did it. These are tasks for the rest of this book. But we will show what a convincing solution has to look like and introduce the clues that lead us to zero in on American politics as our prime suspect. In the next chapter, we will start laying out what we mean when we say, &#x201c;American politics did it.&#x201d; For, as will become clear, resolving our first mystery only raises a deeper one: How, in a political system built on the ideal of political equality and in which middle-class voters are thought to have tremendous sway, has democratic politics contributed so mightily to the shift toward winner-take-all?<br><br><b>Investigating the Scene</b><br><br>As in any investigation, we cannot find the suspects unless we know more or less what happened. A body dead for twenty-four hours yields a very different set of hunches than one dead for twenty-four years. Likewise, we need to be able to characterize the winner-take-all economy in clear, simple, and empirically verifiable terms to rule certain explanations out and others in. Unfortunately, much of the discussion of our current economic state of affairs has lacked such clarity.<br><br>Indeed, most of the economic investigators have actually been looking in the wrong place. Fixated on the widening gap between skilled and unskilled workers, they have divided the economic world into two large groups: the &#x201c;haves&#x201d; with college or advanced degrees; the &#x201c;have-nots&#x201d; without them. The clues suggest, however, that the real mystery is the runaway incomes and assets of the &#x201c;have-it-alls&#x201d;&#x2014;those on the very highest rungs of the economic ladder. These fortunate few are, in general, no better educated or obviously more skilled than those on the rungs just below, who have experienced little or none of these meteoric gains.<br><br>The mystery, further, is not just why the have-it-alls have more and more. It is also how they have managed to restructure the economy to shift the risks of their new economic playground downward, saddling Americans with greater debt, tearing new holes in the safety net, and imposing broad financial risks on Americans as workers, investors, and taxpayers. The rising rewards at the top, as startling and important as they are, are only a symptom of a broader transformation of the American economy. The deeper mystery is how our economy stopped working to provide security and prosperity for the broad middle class. The deeper mystery, the mystery that has yet to be systematically outlined or unraveled, is the rise of the <i>winner-take-all economy</i>.<br><br>A big reason for the continuing confusion is that the largest body of evidence on which economic investigators have traditionally relied fails to capture the crucial facts. Most of those who have asked how the poor, middle class, and rich have fared have examined national surveys of income, such as the Census Bureau&#x2019;s widely used Current Population Survey&#x2014;the basis for those annual summaries of income and poverty trends that appear in the news late each summer. These surveys, however, have a serious problem: They do not reach many rich people and, even when they do, do not usually show their exact incomes. (Instead, they cap the maximum amount disclosed, a practice known as top coding.) As a result, most investigators are examining the winner-take-all economy without looking at the winners at all. It is as if <i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</i> took you on an exciting tour of the financial life of a couple making $125,000 a year (&#x201c;Look: their own washer and dryer!&#x201d;).<br><br>Enter two young economists who have turned the investigation upside down: Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. They are a transcontinental team&#x2014;Piketty is now based at the Paris School of Economics, while Saez is at the University of California, Berkeley (both are natives of France). In 2009, at age thirty-six, Saez was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal for the economist younger than forty making the greatest contribution to the discipline. The medal was, in large part, for pathbreaking work that he and Piketty have done using income tax statistics to paint a new and revealing portrait of the distribution of economic rewards in the United States and other rich nations.1<br><br>Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s approach is simple but revolutionary. Rather than talking to witnesses, the most important of whom (the rich) cannot be easily found, they scour the scene itself. More precisely, Piketty and Saez tap into a source of data that is particularly good at revealing what the have-it-alls actually have: namely, income reported when paying taxes. Information that taxpayers provide about their wages, salaries, capital gains, and other income may contain errors&#x2014;and sometimes deliberate errors. But tax forms require careful documentation that income surveys don&#x2019;t, and taxpayers have strong legal inducements to get the numbers right. More important, the one group that the tax code generally singles out for special scrutiny is the rich, the very people whom income surveys tend to miss. To be sure, the tax data are not without flaws, and Piketty and Saez assiduously try to correct them (for example, they adjust the results to account for the fact that some people don&#x2019;t file tax returns).1 But they are enormously better than survey results in capturing the full distribution of economic rewards.<br><br>And what the Piketty and Saez evidence uniquely shows is just how sharply our economy has tilted toward winner-take-all. Most of the gains of economic growth since the 1970s have gone precisely to those that the commonly used surveys miss&#x2014;not just the top 10 percent, but especially the top 1 percent, and especially the highest reaches of the top 1 percent.<br><br><b>Three Big Clues</b><br><br>Compared with the standard surveys that portray the rich as earning upper-middle-class salaries, Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s data are like DNA evidence in a case previously investigated using only eyewitness accounts. As it turns out, the DNA evidence reveals three essential clues that were previously neglected.<br><br><b>Clue #1: Hyperconcentration of Income</b><br><br>The first clue is that the gains of the winner-take-all economy, befitting its name, have been extraordinarily <i>concentrated</i>. Though economic gaps have grown across the board, the big action is at the top, especially the very top.<br><br>To grasp this point, consider an alternate reality in which income grows at the same pace for all groups in society. In this scenario, the rich get richer at the same rate as everyone else, so the share of national income earned by the rich stays constant. We might call this imaginary country Broadland&#x2014;a counterfactual parallel to the real world of runaway gains at the top that the writer Robert Frank has evocatively termed &#x201c;Richistan.&#x201d;2<br><br>Broadland would not be some kind of egalitarian fantasy. It would simply be a country where economic growth was making the income distribution neither more equal nor less. It would, in fact, be pretty close to the situation that existed from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, a period in which incomes actually grew at a slightly faster rate at the bottom and middle of the economic distribution than at the top.<br><br>But Broadland is not the world of the past generation. Instead, the share of income earned by the top 1 percent has increased from around 8 percent in 1974 to more than 18 percent in 2007 (the last year covered by the data)&#x2014;a more than twofold increase. If you include capital gains like investment and dividend income, the share of the top 1 percent has gone from just over 9 percent to 23.5 percent. The only time since 1913 (the first year of the data) that this share has been higher was 1928, on the eve of the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, when it tickled 24 percent.<br><br>But the top 1 percent, while seemingly an exclusive group, is much too broad a category to pinpoint the most fortunate beneficiaries of the post-1970s income explosion at the top. The Piketty and Saez evidence allows us to climb higher up the economic ladder and peer into the pocketbooks of the richest tenth of a percent and even the richest hundredth of a percent&#x2014;yes, 0.1 percent and 0.01 percent&#x2014;of Americans. The latter comprise the highest-earning 15,000 or so families in the United States, a group in which we would expect <i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</i> to have little trouble finding private jets and opulent mansions.<br><br>Plenty of jets and mansions, it turns out: The top 0.1 percent (the richest one in a thousand households) collectively rake in more than $1 trillion a year including capital gains&#x2014;which works out to an average annual income of more than $7.1 million. In 1974, by comparison, the top 0.1 percent&#x2019;s average income was just over $1 million. (All these incomes are adjusted for inflation by expressing them in 2007 dollars.) In terms of the share of national income earned, the top 0.1 percent have seen their slice of the pie grow from 2.7 percent to 12.3 percent of income&#x2014;a more than <i>fourfold</i> increase.<br><br>We shall say more about <i>who</i> is in this rarefied group in the chapters to come, but for now, let us simply note that its denizens are not, for the most part, superstars and celebrities in the arts, entertainment, and sports. Nor are they rentiers, living off their accumulated wealth, as was true in the early part of the last century. A substantial majority are company executives and managers, and a growing share of these are financial company executives and managers. High earners in law, medicine, real estate, and other potentially lucrative fields also make an appearance, but they pale in prominence to the &#x201c;working rich&#x201d; of the executive world.3<br><br>By now it will come as no surprise that the gains within this superrich group are themselves highly concentrated. While things have been good for the top 0.1 percent, the top 0.01 percent (the richest one in ten thousand households) has seen an even more spectacular rise. From less than $4 million in average annual income in 1974, the average member of this select group now earns more than $35 million. From earning less than 1 of every 100 dollars, these supremely fortunate souls now earn more than 1 of every 17&#x2014;or more than 6 percent of national income accruing to 0.01 percent of families. This is the highest share of income going to this group since the data began to be collected in 1913.<br><br>The more closely we look at changes in the distribution of economic rewards, the more it becomes clear that the big gains have been concentrated at the very, very top.4 According to Piketty and Saez&#x2019;s revealing evidence regarding pre-tax incomes, we have gone from Broadland to Richistan&#x2014;from a world in which most of the nation&#x2019;s income gains accrue to the bottom 90 percent of households (the pattern of the economic expansion of the 1960s) to one in which more than half go to the richest 1 percent (the pattern of the last economic expansion from 2002 to 2007). For those in the tightly circumscribed winner&#x2019;s circle of the winner-take-all economy, the last generation has truly been a golden age.<br><br><b>Clue #2: Sustained Hyperconcentration</b><br><br>The DNA evidence reveals a second important clue: The shift of income toward the top has been <i>sustained,</i> increasing steadily (and, by historical standards, extremely rapidly) since around 1980.<br><br>Figure 1 tells the story. The poor may not be getting poorer, but the rich have been steadily pulling away: in good times (the strong economy of the mid-to late 1990s) and in bad times (the very weak economy of the early 1980s); under Republican presidents (Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, whose presidencies are shaded in gray on the figure) and under Democratic President Clinton. The only brief reversals occur during the dives in the stock market that occurred in the late 1980s and around 2000. But the occasional setback associated with a decline in the stock market has only been a springboard to new heights. For thirty years, the good times have just kept rolling.<br><br>The solution to our mystery, in short, needs to account for a simple fact: The rising share of national income captured by the richest Americans is a long-term trend beginning around 1980. It is a trend, moreover, that is not obviously related to either the business cycle or the shifting partisan occupancy of the White House.5 The partisan to-and-fro and economic ebb and flow surely had some part to play. But something else was at work in creating the winner-take-all economy&#x2014;something that fostered a sharp divide between broadly shared prosperity and winner-take-all.<br><br><b><b>The Richest 1 Percent&#x2019;s Share of National Income (Including Capital Gains), 1960&#x2013;2007</b></b><br><br><b>Clue #3: Limited Benefits for the Nonrich</b><br><br>We come, finally, to the third clue&#x2014;and perhaps the most puzzling of all. It is so puzzling, and potentially controversial, that we spend much of the rest of this chapter documenting and delving into it.<br><br>The third clue is this: In an era in which those at the top reaped massive gains, the economy stopped working for middle- and working-class Americans. We know that the rich grew fabulously richer over this period. We know that relative to the rich, the rest of Americans lost ground. But what we have not yet investigated is whether they lost ground overall. How well did they fare in an era in which so large a share of economic gains accrued to those above them? Did they become richer and more economicall...</p><h2>The Quilt: Stories from the Names Project</h2><p>Brings together a compelling sampling of the panels that make up the beautiful quilt dedicated to those who have fallen victim to AIDS--a project created by family, friends, and companions in memory of their loved ones</p><p></p><h2>Dogs: The Ultimate Dictionary of over 1,000 Breeds</h2><p>This is a reprint of a 2001 edition reference that aims for comprehensive coverage of the origins and characteristics of every identifiable dog breed in the world. Over 1,000 entries are organized by type of breed (e.g. scenthounds, livestock guards, sled dogs, etc.) and then grouped according to country. Coverage extends to wolf/dog hybrids, feral dogs, wild dogs, and obscure breeds about which little is known. Animal behaviorist Morris is past Curator of Mammals at the London Zoo. Over 500 of Philip Hood&#39;s drawings of various breeds of dogs illustrate the volume. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Desmond Morris&#x2014;renowned animal behaviorist and author of the best&#x2013;selling <b>Catwatching, Dogwatching, Horsewatching,</b> and <b>The Naked Ape</b>&#x2014;now presents the ultimate reference work on dog breeds. This comprehensive survey encompasses breeds from around the world. From household pets to wild dogs, hunting hounds to sheep&#x2013;, cattle&#x2013;, even fish&#x2013;herders, Morris provides the history, qualities, and characteristics of each one. In addition, he offers a fascinating look at conflicting theories of canine behavior. Expert, meticulously researched information combined with superb illustrations make this a must&#x2013;have for all dog lovers.Animal lovers have long been captivated by Morris' fascinating work in the field of animal behavior. This addition to his oeuvre will not disappoint. Morris says this is the reference book he always wanted. It didn't exist so he wrote it! While most standard guides focus on a breed's physical standards for the show ring, this guide downplays that aspect and instead gives a historical perspective.<p>More than 1,000 dog breeds are covered. Breeds that are officially recognized and registered by major kennel clubs are included, but this dictionary also encompasses unrecognized breeds that have played a part in the history of domestic dogs. New breeds such as the Schnoodle, service dogs for the disabled, and even dogs once bred for human consumption are discussed, as are wild dogs, wolf-dog hybrids, and obscure and extinct breeds.</p><p>Presentation and organization of breed information is unique. Dogs are arranged first according to their original function--"Sporting Dogs," "Livestock Dogs," and "Service Dogs." Within these broad categories the animals are separated by functional specialty, such as "Sighthounds," "Sheep-herders," and "Rescue Dogs." For each group, a short overview essay is followed by entries for specific breeds, arranged by country of origin. The physical appearance and disposition of the dog are described, along with the breed's history and development over time, as well as the background of the breed name. (There was at one time a breed called a Turnspit whose name precisely described its function--running in a wheel that turned meat being roasted before a fire.) Information about relationships among breeds and controversies among canine experts adds an interesting dimension. Some breeds are represented in small black-and-white drawings. In addition to an extensive annotated bibliography, a list of references appears after many entries. There is an alphabetical index of 3,000 breed names, with those appearing in the dictionary in capital letters.</p><p>Although not replacing official kennel club guides, this title will be a valuable supplementary source of information for dog lovers. It offers hours of delightful browsing through the history of man's best friend. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After an explosion, a new crime by an old murderer, and the sad passing of the town's founder, twelve-year-old Jack will soon find himself launched on a mission that takes him hundreds of miles away, escorting his slightly mental elderly mentor, Miss Volker, on her relentless pursuit of the oddest of outlaws. But as their trip turns south in more ways than one, it's increasingly clear that the farther from home they travel, the more off-the-wall Jack and Miss Volker's adventure becomes, in <i>From Norvelt to Nowhere</i>, a raucous road novel about roots and revenge, a last chance at love, and the power of a remarkable friendship.</p><p>A <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Children's Book of 2013</p></p><p><p><b>Katherine Applegate Interviews Jack Gantos</b></p> <p><strong>Katherine Applegate:</strong> Your alter-ego Jackie Gantos is back!

There are so many good scenes. There is the harpoon scene, and the pistol escapade, and the over imbibing, the creepy bathroom stall scene ... I&#x2019;ll settle on the scene where Miss Volker is using the sandwich bread to wipe the unending tears from her guilty crying while the soggy bread balls roll down her face like they were little white garden snails.

He traveled from England and began the town which was built on socialist/utopic principles. The town was a perfect fit for Miss Volker&#x2019;s childhood back story, and it had been abandoned for many years. But it has had a bit of a revival.

The boy seemed very troubled. I replied as sincerely as possible, "Well, he lived a wonderful life for many, many years until finally ... he expired."</p> <p>He shifted from foot to foot and thought about that last word. Finally he asked, "What does expired mean?"</p> <p>I paused. Time was passing. The other kids were getting restless so I got to the point. "It means he died," I said.</p> <p>He thought about that, then asked, "Well, did you stuff him?"</p> <p>"I should have," I replied while thinking, dang, I really should have. But it was too late for that.</p> <p><strong>KA:</strong> When you autograph books, you often write "Read or Rot!" Why?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Oh, it&#x2019;s just a fun little motto that basically boils down to Read books or your brain will Rot. I usually draw a skull and write READ OR ROT! in blood red ink across the forehead. Kids like it.</p> <p><strong>KA:</strong> Writing pre-Newbery. Writing post-Newbery. Any difference?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> There are differences but they are all very shadowy. There are no statements to be made about the differences. There are only questions. I honestly don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time pondering this as I&#x2019;ll probably invent a problem where none exists.</p> <p><strong>KA:</strong> Where do you keep your Medal?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> In the freezer.

While refusing to dream may protect us from unmet expectations, it can also keep us from experiencing the beauty God is creating in our lives.

" More than 95 percent are poor," the pastor says-"the poorest of the poor, poor by any standard I can think of."</p><p>At the elementary school that serves the neighborhood across the avenue, only seven of 800 children do not qualify for free school lunches. "Five of those seven," says the principal, "get reduced-price lunches, because they are classified as only 'poor,' not 'destitute.' "</p><p>In some cities, the public reputation of a ghetto neighborhood bears little connection to the world that you discover when you walk the streets with children and listen to their words. In Mott Haven, this is not the case. By and large, the words of the children in the streets and schools and houses that surround St. Ann's more than justify the grimness in the words of journalists who have described the area.</p><p>Crack-cocaine addiction and the intravenous use of heroin, which children I have met here call "the needle drug," are woven into the texture of existence in Mott Haven. Nearly 4,000 heroin injectors, many of whom are HIV-infected, live here. Virtually every child at St. Ann's knows someone, a relative or neighbor, who has died of AIDS, and most children here know many others who are dying now of the disease. One quarter of the women of Mott Haven who are tested in obstetric wards are positive for HIV. Rates of pediatric AIDS, therefore, are high.</p><p>Depression is common among children in Mott Haven. Many cry a great deal but cannot explain exactly why.</p><p>Fear and anxiety are common. Many cannot sleep.</p><p>Asthma is the most common illness among children here. Many have to struggle to take in a good deep breath. Some mothers keep oxygen tanks, which children describe as "breathing machines," next to their children's beds.</p><p>The houses in which these children live, two thirds of which are owned by the City of New York, are often as squalid as the houses of the poorest children I have visited in rural Mississippi, but there is none of the greenness and the healing sweetness of the Mississippi countryside outside their windows, which are often barred and bolted as protection against thieves.</p><p>Some of these houses are freezing in the winter. In dangerously cold weather, the city sometimes distributes electric blankets and space heaters to its tenants. In emergency conditions, if space heaters can't be used, because substandard wiring is overloaded, the city's practice, according to <i>Newsday</i>, is to pass out sleeping bags.</p><p>"You just cover up ... and hope you wake up the next morning," says a father of four children, one of them an infant one month old, as they prepare to climb into their sleeping bags in hats and coats on a December night.</p><p>In humid summer weather, roaches crawl on virtually every surface of the houses in which many of the children live. Rats emerge from holes in bedroom walls, terrorizing infants in their cribs. In the streets outside, the restlessness and anger that are present in all seasons frequently intensify under the stress of heat.</p><p>In speaking of rates of homicide in New York City neighborhoods, the Times refers to the streets around St. Ann's as "the deadliest blocks" in "the deadliest precinct" of the city. If there is a deadlier place in the United States, I don't know where it is.</p><p>In 1991, 84 people, more than half of whom were 21 or younger, were murdered in the precinct. A year later, ten people were shot dead on a street called Beckman Avenue, where many of the children I have come to know reside. On Valentine's Day of 1993, three more children and three adults were shot dead on the living room floor of an apartment six blocks from the run-down park that serves the area.</p><p>In early july of 1993, shortly before the first time that I visited the neighborhood, three more people were shot in 30 minutes in tree unrelated murders in the South Bronx, one of them only a block from St. Ann's Avenue. A week later, a mother was murdered and her baby wounded by a bullet in the stomach while they were standing on a South Bronx corner. Three weeks after that, a minister and elderly parishioner were shot outside the front door of their church, while another South Bronx resident was discovered in his bathtub with his head cut off. In subsequent days, a man was shot in both his eyes and a ten-year-old was critically wounded in the brain.</p><p>What is it like for children to grow up here? What do they think the world has done to them? Do they believe that they are being shunned or hidden by society? If so, do they think that they deserve this? What is it that enables some of them to pray? When they pray, what do they say to God?</p></p><h2>The Vegetable Thieves</h2><p>The Vegetable Thieves</p><p></p><h2>The Cat Who...

Her honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship, a PEN/Voelcker Award, and a Theodore Roethke Memorial Poetry Prize. She is a distinguished professor in the MFA Program in Creative Writing &amp; Literary Translation, Queens College, City University of New York, and lives in Queens.A kind of poet's journal or miscellany, mixing verse with prose, considered ideas with spontaneous exclamations, notes to friends and even e-mails, Hahn's seventh book adapts the traditional Japanese prose poetry genre <i>zuihitsu</i> to modern American aims. The notebook form allows room for scenes in Brooklyn and on Cape Cod; the poet's feelings about her preteen daughter and her former husband; her thoughts on academia and on Asian-Americanness; her experience of her own body, in youth, in sex and in middle age; and her reactions to 9/11. Honesty has long stood among Hahn's strengths: "I want hands on my face the way no husband or woman has ever held me." Childhood recollections are also movingly evoked: "I need not write about those snow forts where I lay on my back looking up at the ceiling turning into twilight, my mother calling from the trite threshold." Hahn's self-consciousness about this cross-cultural form&#x2014;a recurring theme&#x2014;can become self-indulgent, and the development comes not from a change in Hahn, but from the terrorist attack on her city. No revelation emerges at notebook's end.

Honey bees, and the daily workings of their close-knit colonies, are one of nature's great miracles. And they produce one of nature's greatest edible bounties: honey. More than just a palate pleaser, honey was once an offering to the gods, a preservative, and a medicine whose sought-after curative powers were detailed in ancient texts . . . and are being rediscovered by modern medical science.<br><br>In <b>Letters from the Hive</b>, Prof. Stephen Buchmann takes us into the hive--nursery, honey factory, queen's inner sanctum--and out to the world of backyard gardens, open fields, and deserts in full bloom, where the age-old sexual dance between flowers and bees makes life on earth as we know it possible. Hailed for their hard work, harmonious society, and, mistakenly, for their celibacy, bees have a link to our species that goes beyond biology. In <b>Letters from the Hive</b>, Buchmann explores the fascinating role of bees in human culture and mythology, following the "honey hunters" of native cultures in Malaysia, the Himalayas, and the Australian Outback as they risk life and limb to locate a treasure as valuable as any gold.<br><br>To contemplate a world without bees is to imagine a desolate place, culturally and biologically, and Buchmann shows how with each acre of land sacrificed to plow, parking lot, or shopping mall, we inch closer to what could become a chilling reality. He also offers honey-based recipes, cooking tips, and home remedies--further evidence of the gifts these creatures have bestowed on us.<br><br>Told with wit, wisdom, and affection, and rich with anecdote and science, <b>Letters from the Hive</b> is nature writing at its best. This is natural history to be treasured, a sweet tribute that buzzes with life.</p><p>Stephen Buchmann is an amateur beekeeper, associate professor of entomology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, author of <i>The Forgotten Pollinators</i>, and founder of The Bee Works, an environmental company.<br><br>Banning Repplier is a writer who lives in New York City.Chapter 1<br>The Beginning of an Enduring Passion: <br>Prehistoric Honey Hunters<br>O bees, sweet bees! I said: that nearest field<br>Is shining white with fragrant immortelles.<br>Fly swiftly there and drain those honey wells.<br>--Helen Hunt Jackson, <br>"My Bees"<br>A few years ago, when I was still keeping honey bees in my Tucson backyard, I always found it particularly exciting to check my hives in late spring, after the blooms had begun and the honey had started to flow. What had my bees been up to? What would the honey crop taste like? If generous winter and early spring rains had tickled the sandy desert soils and brought them to life, there could have been an explosion of wildflowers. Even with normal precipitation, the old desert standbys--velvet mesquite, foothill, and littleleaf paloverde trees--would break out in riotous bloom, attracting hungry bees from far and wide. Tens of thousands of them would plunder the flowers and carry home the precious nectar, transforming it into golden honey--a sweet, fragrant crop that I was always eager to sample.<br><br>Whenever I cracked the lid of one of my hives, the bees would rush up toward the light to see what had disrupted the cozy tranquility and comforting darkness of their nest. Selecting a middle frame fat with honey, I would ease it up and out of the box while the bees, clinging to its surfaces, ran about chaotically, confused by this rude interruption of their smooth, efficient daytime routine. Only days before, worker bees would have sealed the crinkly, textured surface of the honeycomb with the virgin white beeswax they secrete as tiny scales and form into cell caps through the workings of their mandibles.<br><br>This was the moment I had been longing for throughout the long winter months--a perfect day in late April with the first honey crop of the year ready to taste, waiting for me beneath those brilliant white caps. Since I never wore clumsy bee gloves, I was able to thrust my right forefinger deep into the comb and drag it across the frame, rupturing more than a hundred cells and releasing the glistening honey, which would stream out in thick little rivulets with the bees in hot pursuit. Withdrawing my finger, I would savor my prize, for there is nothing in the world like the taste of warm, fresh honey straight from the comb.<br><br>I am not alone in my passion for honey-making bees and their honey. From prehistoric times to the present, we humans have felt a mysterious and enduring connection to these furry little creatures and the food they produce. We have endowed them with magical properties, attributed to them surprising healing and cleansing powers, and seen in them meaningful symbols representing some of our most profoundly held beliefs.<br><br>Our fascination with bees is deeply rooted in our collective consciousness. We see it in the cave paintings that our prehistoric ancestors left behind. We can read it in the rich, complex rituals and traditions that evolved to govern our relationship with these admirable insects. And we can still catch the reverberations of our instinctive connection to that part of the natural world every time a husband calls his wife "honey" or an excited child chases a buzzing bee through a bright summer afternoon. But its influence is much more far-reaching than you might imagine, extending not just to everyday moments of affection and play but to diverse cultures, religious beliefs, cuisines, and scientific study around the world. We can look for its roots in our history and, before that, our prehistory.<br><br>Thanks to petroglyphs, the spectacular painted records still visible on cave walls throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, and even Australia, we know our ancestors definitely had a sweet tooth, and we know that they indulged it by embarking on arduous and often dangerous honey hunts, armed with tools that enabled them to pillage bee nests with remarkable efficiency. We don't know why cave artists put so much effort into recording these often dramatic hunts. Perhaps the honey hunts signified something more profound than the simple harvesting of an ingredient to sweeten their days--something with deep religious or ceremonial meaning. Whatever the reason, vivid paintings chronicling those honey-hunting expeditions--beautifully stylized yet powerfully real--have been found on the ceilings and walls of hundreds of caves spanning the globe.<br><br>In her recent book <i>The Rock Art of Honey Hunters</i>, Dr. Eva Crane, the grande dame of honey bee researchers, has collected some of the most striking examples of the cave art chronicling these prehistoric hunts. As she has vividly documented, there are a number of common elements that recur throughout this pictorial world. The honeycombs are prominently drawn, generally with great exuberance and appearing much larger than they are in real life. Bees, with or without wings, are shown flying angrily about as their nests are pillaged by the daring hunters. The hunters themselves are usually depicted either standing at the foot of a tree or cliff that harbors a bee nest or climbing long rope ladders to reach their prize. And they are typically shown naked--although to modern beekeepers, the idea of raiding a colony without protective clothing seems foolhardy at best. The honey hunters portrayed in African cave art frequently wear penis sheaths and nothing else.<br><br>When looking at photographs of some of these paintings, I can't help thinking of the brilliant frescoes that transformed the walls of medieval and Renaissance churches into graphic lessons in religious and moral history. The cave painters, who created their art thousands of years before, using mineral pigments mixed with animal fats, may also have wanted to give their work a didactic or sacred meaning. There are several clues that support this supposition: the cave walls that served as their canvases enclosed spaces large enough to have comfortably accommodated crowds of people gathered to watch or participate in ceremonial rituals; the subjects of the paintings--hunting and fertility rites--are the kind that lend themselves to sacramental reenactment; and, in addition to the honey- and animal-hunting scenes, some of the paintings show women engaged in what seems to be sacred dancing, groups of archers led by a priest or shaman wearing a large headdress, and warriors engaged in hand-to-hand combat.<br><br>I'd love to know what lessons, if any, our forebears found embedded in the painted chronicles of their honey hunts. Did the rituals of the hunt serve to enlighten them or to give them spiritual guidance? Did they inspire these nomadic clans to strive for the same kind of efficient, productive social organization that the bees had so wonderfully evolved? And what role did honey play in their daily lives? Was it a key ingredient in their primitive cuisine, a medicine used to cure a number of ills, or simply eaten raw as a palate-pleasing, energy-supplying snack after a long, hard day hunting and gathering?<br><br>Despite the dedicated work of many archaeologists, we'll probably never know the answers to these questions. But based on hunting scenes found in caves separated by thousands of miles (and executed with uncanny similarity), we can safely say that plundering bee nests has been an important human activity for many millennia, all over the globe. In fact, there are places in the world today where the ancient rituals of those long-ago honey hunters are still practiced virtually unchanged. In the rainforests of Malaysia, the remote valleys of Nepal, and the vast Australian outback, honey-hunting clans set out on expeditions so similar to those depicted in prehistoric cave art that those paintings might well have served as their primers. We will actually travel to Malaysia to witness some of those rituals as they unfold today. But first, let's travel back in time, to a cave that contains one of the most vivid of the ancient honey-hunting paintings.<br><br>We are at La Arana--the Cave of the Spider. It is one of many caves and prehistoric shelters honeycombing the limestone mountains of what is now the province of Valencia, near the city of the same name, on the east coast of Spain. Six thousand years ago, when the paintings at La Ara&#x2013;a were executed, Europe had just entered the First Neolithic Age, which lasted for another thousand years.<br><br>Though we tend to think of the people who used these caves as cave dwellers, they were actually nomadic hunters and gatherers who lived in extended families or small bands and stayed in the rock shelters only for brief periods as they traveled with the seasons. The caves were often located in hillsides that offered wide views of animal migration routes and, as a result, prime hunting opportunities. The caves also provided protection from the elements and probably from natural predators and human enemies as well. Beyond their role as temporary sanctuaries, they served as burial chambers and meeting places for clans scattered over hundreds of miles. Thus the caves helped facilitate communication and intermarriage among these dispersed peoples.<br><br>The La Arana cave, explored in 1924 by Spanish archaeologist Hern&#x2021;ndez Pacheco, is set in a landscape of wild natural beauty, with rugged slopes, deep gullies, and clear-running rivers. Blackened soot on the low ceiling near the entrance indicates that early humans took shelter there, lighting fires to provide warmth and cook their meals, and recording the events of daily life in paintings on the interior walls.<br><br>Let's imagine a cold, damp winter afternoon six thousand years ago in the cave of La Arana. A small band of men, women, and children has gathered around a roaring blaze at the mouth of the cave to recount their day's activities, which include not just hunting and gathering but also crafting and maintaining a wide variety of tools, stitching animal skins together with bone needles to make warm clothing to fight off the bitter cold of winter, nursing infants, and preparing meals. Implements essential to their survival lay scattered about and include hand axes, cleavers, and scrapers to work hide and shape wood. Barbed harpoons and spears, made from bone and antler and decorated with carved animal designs as well as various ornamental pendants, can also be seen. The tools are well made, for this is a period of great innovation. Change is occurring at an increasingly rapid rate and will continue over the next centuries as agriculture takes root, the nomads settle in villages, a hunter-gatherer economy transitions to a producing one, and a whole new way of life is born. In fact, our friends in the cave may have already begun rudimentary farming to supplement the fruits of their hunting and gathering expeditions.<br><br>As the day wanes, dinner is served at La Arana. Items on the menu include reindeer, bison, ibex, horse, and red deer. And the piece de resistance is honey, dripping thick and golden from the comb.<br><br>Like nearly everything our ancestors used, honey had to be pilfered from the natural world around them--right from the nests of the bees themselves. Except for a small number of tropical wasps and ants, no other creatures collect and store concentrated reserves of sugar the way honey bees do. In Spain, the honey would have come from the European honey bee (Apis mellifera).<br><br>The challenges of harvesting honey were daunting, as we can see in the painting for which the Cave of the Spider is best known--a compelling rendition of the rigors and rituals of the honey hunt. Using a concavity in the rock wall to represent a bee nest, the painter drew a man climbing what appears to be a rope ladder and being attacked by a swarm of enormous bees defending their honey stores. The honey hunter is simply sketched, a fragile-looking stick figure, yet we sense skill, strength, and determination as he balances precariously on his flimsy ladder, enduring the painful stings and angry harassment of the bees. We also sense that something mysterious, something we can't quite grasp, is going on here. There is an almost spiritual quality to the painting, which suggests a tacit understanding between the bees and the barbarian who is attacking their stronghold. This is not simply a callous plundering of goods, a cold-blooded raid. It's as if we are witnessing a sacred contest, a battle of wills between equals. Perhaps the special relationship between humans and bees, which was to evolve into so many elaborate rituals and traditions over the millennia, had already begun to take shape.<br>The cave paintings leave no doubt that honey hunting has been going on for thousands of years. Long before the first humans descended from the thorny acacia trees of the African savannahs and began a new life as tool-making, fully bipedal primates, Malaysian honey bears, honey guide birds, and South African honey badgers were all plundering bee nests. But it was the ingenuity of our early ancestors that turned the honey hunt into a highly ritualized--and effective--activity. It probably didn't take long for prehistoric hunters and gatherers to discover that the nests of certain highly social bees--bumblebees (Bombus), stingless bees (Melipona and Trigona), and honey bees (Apis mellifera and other species in the genus Apis)--contained plentiful reserves of honey. And once they had figured that out, it was doubtless a short step to learning how to attack and exploit these tasty, energy-rich targets.<br><br>No one has been able to trace the evolution of the human sweet tooth, which is certainly at the root of our passion for bees and honey. We do know that our ape and chimpanzee relatives have a well-developed taste for sugar and aren't shy about availing themselves of any opportunity to gorge on it. And we also know that besides the honey from bees, the only other concentrated sources of sugar available to early humans would have been fruits, berries, and certain tropical grasses. So the honey stored by bees was a prize well worth enduring the stings delivered by the guardians of the nests. Other "spoils of war" from the nests included the juicy, protein-rich brood, consisting of bee larvae and pupae, along with equally nutritious pollen. It is little wonder that so many kinds of mammals and birds in the prehistoric world developed a taste for honey and young bees, along with the necessary skills for locating bee nests and breaking into their well-stocked pantries.<br><br>La Arana is just one of many caves in Spain where we can see paintings that memorialize our species' long-standing craving for honey. Several rock shelters in Teruel province in eastern Spain depict outraged bees that seem to issue forth from the rock itself to attack the greedy honey hunters. At Barranc Fondo in eastern Spain, a petroglyph painted about the same time as the one in La Ara&#x2013;a shows at least five stick-figure honey hunters climbing a ladder leaning against a large tree. The spirits of large grazing animals and other creatures hover around the top of the tree, lending an air of magic and otherworldliness to the scene. But then in a note of earthy realism, we see one hapless hunter tumbling backward off the ladder, arms flailing in the air. Executed in black, which was derived from charcoal, and red, from ocher, the painting also depicts at least eleven other hunters gathered at the foot of the ladder, waiting for the stitched-hide honey buckets to descend from on high. This scene of hunters anticipating the arrival of their hard-earned plunder is virtually identical to what we will witness in Malaysia when we accompany modern-day honey hunters on an actual expedition.</p><h2>Simple Wisdom for Rich Living</h2><p>Inspirational insights from the author, a life-long Mississippi laundress, who in July 1995 at the age of eighty-seven gave $150,000 to the University of Mississippi to establish a scholarship fund and became a national heroine.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Armenian Cookbook</h2><p>The Middle Eastern recipes in Mrs. Bezjian&#39;s book are not easily found in other cookbooks.

Robb also visits a scientist at MIT who is mapping out how dreams work to enhance problem-solving skills in rats and travels to the Netherlands to attend a meeting of the International Association for the Study of Dreams. She even has the fortitude to partake in &#x201c;group analysis,&#x201d; allowing six friends and a therapist to interpret a bizarre scenario featuring a line-dancing Hillary Clinton.

Shade collaborate to provide a comprehensive, accessible, one-volume history of Virginia, the first of its kind since the 1970s.</p><p> In seventeen narrative chapters, the authors tackle the four centuries of Virginia&#x2019;s history from Jamestown through the present, emphasizing the major themes that play throughout Virginia history&#x2015;change and continuity, a conservative political order, race and slavery, economic development, and social divisions&#x2015;and how they relate to national events. Including helpful bibliographical listings at the end of each chapter as well as a general listing of useful sources and Websites, the book is truly a treasure trove for any student, scholar, or general-interest reader looking to find out more about the history of Virginia and our nation.

Reed set out to examine the lives of nuns, she was fulfilling a personal quest, discovering for herself what was behind the mysterious image instilled by her Protestant upbringing and reinforced by Hollywood cliches, misguided speculation, and her Catholic friends' childhood stories of unyielding figures in black.<br>So began a journalistic pursuit of an enigmatic subculture, during which Reed interviewed more than three hundred nuns of diverse beliefs and lifestyles - from cloistered and isolated to untraditional and activist - from more than fifty different orders across the country. Is the sisterhood still a viable option for women in today's society? Why had so many of these women entered the strict, habited orders? How could they possibly exert their own identity in a world of such conformity? And why were they so willing to give up material pleasures, money, the company of men and sex? The answers not only changed Reed's perspective on nuns, they changed Reed's perspective on herself and on her life.<br>She lived and prayed with them, observed their daily lives, and participated in silent worship. She witnessed their vow ceremonies, mourned with them, celebrated and drank with them. They welcomed questions no one had ever dared ask before. Reed listened to their personal stories and candid musings about love and sex, life and death, faith and joy, loss and regret. In the end, the nuns Reed had approached with suspicion and curiosity ended up reaching her more about motherhood, relationships, and feminism than she ever gleaned from the outside world.</p><p>Cheryl L. Reed's articles have appeared in <i>Time, U.S. News and World Report, Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine</i>, Salon.com, and the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i>, among others. She is the recipient of the Harvard University Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting and the Edgar Allen Poe Award from the White House Correspondent Association. She is currently a visiting professor at the University of St. Thomas.Although the title of this book hints at a possibly salacious expose, Reed offers a generous, loving and thorough treatment of contemporary North American nuns. What is most arresting about her portrait is the tremendous diversity among the women she profiles. In one chapter, we meet habited, cloistered Passionist nuns who rise at 2 a.m. to pray, flog their bare skin, and speak for only one hour each day; they stand shoulder-to-shoulder with activist sisters who teach in universities, work as prison chaplains or minister to drug addicts in urban safehouses. Reed acknowledges that the numbers of active women religious are down to almost a third of what they were in the mid-1960s, and that their average age today is a superannuated 69. However, she doesn't allow these grim statistics to tell the entire story, introducing us to sisters so dedicated and fascinating that we become optimistic about the future of women religious. Reed, a non-Catholic, writes from the best tradition of investigative journalism, but she doesn't pretend to be unmoved by the stories of everyday heroism displayed by the women she describes, and chronicles her own spiritual journey throughout. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I&#x2019;d overheard the name once or twice in my childhood, but without context&#x2014;the where, the why, and the what of his story&#x2014;his name had no resonance. My instructor paused a beat more before alleviating our curiosity. &#x201c;Nat Turner led the most successful slave revolt in American history.&#x201d; The words &#x201c;slave&#x201d; and &#x201c;revolt&#x201d; in the same sentence seemed incongruent. He went on, &#x201c;This revolt would not only send shock waves across this entire nation, but would aid in precipitating the American Civil War.&#x201d; I blinked back incredulity. Anyone who knew anything of American history knew enslaved Africans endured, but didn&#x2019;t dare fight. Anyone whose education mirrored my own knew it was benevolent Abe Lincoln who, following his moral compass, led this country to war, with the hope of freeing the slaves. This was what I had been taught, facts inscribed in the history books of my youth. If this Nat Turner truly existed, wouldn&#x2019;t he, too, have been in those same books? It made no sense. As confused as I was, it was my professor&#x2019;s next statement that rocked me the most. &#x201c;This revolt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it took place in Southampton County, Virginia.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the saying goes, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I grew up in Norfolk, Virginia, about forty-two miles east of Southampton County, Virginia. A decade of history courses and yet not once had there been a lesson, a lecture, or an assignment about the slave preacher, &#x201c;General Nat&#x201d;&#x2014;the literate man of God who would engage in a holy war, sacrificing all he had to lead his people out of bondage. At that moment, I vowed to never again take another person&#x2019;s word regarding the narrative of my ancestors. It was then that I took hold of my miseducation and became hell-bent on untangling the twisted threads of its revisionist narrative. My independent study led me not only to Nat Turner but also to countless others who rose and fell in the name of liberation: Toussaint Louverture, Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, to name a few. This desperate journey toward truth became my purpose, my North Star. It would not only serve in expanding my knowledge regarding this country&#x2019;s past, it would serve as the impetus of my desire to explore Nat Turner&#x2019;s life using the platform of film.<br> <br>When I decided to produce a film on Nat Turner, I wanted to be very intentional about drawing parallels between the past and the present. I felt this would be the best way to provide context to many of the obstacles we face as I write with race in this country and in the entertainment industry. In society, there have been countless culprits responsible for both planting and spreading seeds of racial injustice. In film, all signals point to D.W. Griffith and his 1915 propaganda film The Birth of a Nation. This film was not only successful in influencing a massive swath of the country&#x2019;s population to embrace white supremacy as a form of self-preservation, it also laid a rock-solid foundation for this country&#x2019;s interracial affairs, one that still stands today. Set during the Civil War and Reconstruction, this film used carefully arranged moving images to tap deeply into the subconscious of an entire nation. In the wake of the film&#x2019;s release, we saw not only the resurgence of the near extinct Ku Klux Klan, but also the then president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, hail the movie as a massive triumph. While studying this film, two things became immediately clear to me. First, that we are now harvesting the results of the seeds planted by Griffith all those years ago. And second, if we as an industry are to move forward, we must confront the injuries of our past. Reclaiming Griffith&#x2019;s title and repurposing it as a tool for progress and social justice was, in my mind, a good first step. The title, The Birth of a Nation, became a call to action, a challenge to all to &#x201c;birth&#x201d; a new nation of storytellers, truth speakers, and justice seekers. What Griffith used to hardwire, I would use to rewire. What he used for subjugation, I would use for liberation. I had a plan. I had a title. I had my hero. Yet I had no script.<br> <br>When I began writing the script, I knew I wanted to present the story of a hero. I was less interested in the &#x201c;typical&#x201d; slave narrative, which hinges upon rampant victimization where the enslaved have little recourse. Instead, I wanted a story in which the hero clearly sees resistance as an option to overcoming his oppression. Brian Favors, an educator, wrote in reference to the film, &#x201c;Individuals like Patrick Henry, known for his revolutionary ideals of &#x2018;liberty or death,&#x2019; and William &#x2018;Braveheart&#x2019; Wallace are deemed heroic because of their courage to pay the ultimate price for freedom against obstacles that are too frightening for most to confront. For people of African descent, who continue to experience racial oppression, cultural heroes are in short supply. Patrick Henry&#x2019;s belief that &#x2018;the great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able may have a gun,&#x2019; was part of an American tradition that so revered freedom from colonial oppression that the use of violence to resist was considered sacrosanct. His heroic declaration of &#x2018;give me liberty or give me death,&#x2019; serves as a symbol of strength and sacrifice to white Americans who continue to utilize this battle cry to cultivate patriotism and pride. Unfortunately, black heroes who exhibit acts of courage in the face of racial oppression are rarely, if ever, acknowledged.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Roasted Vegetable</h2><p>In The Roasted Vegetable, Andrea Chesman shows how every vegetable imaginable can be oven-roasted to succulent perfection, and she offers a wide-ranging collection of 150 mouthwatering recipes to please even the fussiest eaters. With recipes from simply sensational sides like Mixed Roasted Mushrooms in a Soy Vinaigrette to satisfying main dishes like Baked Orzo with Roasted Fennel and Red Peppers, vegetable lovers and vegetable haters alike will find here tasty, tempting dishes that don&#39;t require a lot of fuss.</p><p>"This is a cookbook for vegetable lovers--and vegetable haters," says Andrea Chesman in <i>The Roasted Vegetable</i>. Her argument is that roasting veggies brings out their "hidden sweet, nutty flavors," making them irresistible to carrot-hating kids and vegan adults alike. She supports this theory with 150 tantalizing recipes, starting with a sizeable serving of side dishes, then broadening to include salsas, soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, tofu, granola, and more. Beyond obvious inclusions like roasted peppers, french fries, and chestnuts, there's Garlic Puree ("like a basic black dress, it goes with almost anything") and Roasted Kohlrabi, which "looks like a spaceship that has sprouted leaves." Another standout is the Roasted Tomato Sauce, for which tomatoes are roasted up to one and a half hours until they've broken down to form a thick sauce; the recipe also has variations for pasta, enchiladas, and Middle Eastern dishes. In addition, the book covers basic techniques and equipment and includes a handy roasting chart--all aimed to help readers' roasted vegetables come out perfectly "tender-crisp." <i>--Andy Boynton</i><p><b>Andrea Chesman</b> has been a food writer, cookbook author, and editor for three decades.

Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorAnne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Born and raised in the heartland of Tennessee and Indiana, as far away from salt water as a young man can get, Bundrant knew nothing about Alaska or how wild seafood was caught and processed. But he knew how to dream, and he had what it takes to chase a dream down with unwavering determination and the ability to enlist others to do things they would never have done on their own. The pursuit began in a '53 Ford station wagon, jammed tight with three other boys he'd talked into quitting college after one semester. Bundrant's plan was to point the Ford west to Seattle and make their way north to Alaska in the dead of winter, 1961. <p></p> <p> Progress was slow at first. One by one, the others fell by the wayside, but Bundrant pressed on. He beat the docks at Fishermen's Terminal in Seattle until he finally landed a job bustin' freezers loaded with trays of frozen king crab meat aboard an old hulk of a floating processor, anchored at the end of the Aleutian chain on the remote island of Adak. Undaunted by bar fights, drownings and drunken skippers, he worked his way up from the bottom of the freezer hold to become captain of his first crab vessel. Eventually he met up with Kaare Ness and Mike Jacobson. Together they built the 135-foot <i>Billikin</i> and established Trident Seafoods, fulfilling Bundrant's vision of harvesting and processing king crab aboard the same vessel and bypassing the established crab processors on the beach. From there, as Bundrant recalls, "We were off to the races"; with a fleet of 'hostile and mobile' processing vessels that capitalized on the strong yen and the developing Japanese market for frozen crab, salmon and herring from Alaska. By the early '80s the king crab resource had collapsed, but Trident remained young, nimble and hungry. Undaunted by risk, Bundrant shifted course and pioneered the whitefish market for cod and pollock fillets by blasting a one-of-a-kind shorebased processing facility out of a mountainside on the remote island of Akutan. Today, Trident's harvesting and processing network covers Alaska on land and at sea, and its finished products are sold in more than 50 countries. Bundrant's race was a race to the top. When he arrived in Seattle in 1961, he had $80 in his pocket. Currently, Trident provides employment for more than 10,000 people around the world. </p> <p> As the book jacket notes: The story of Chuck Bundrant and Trident Seafoods is more than a business biography. It's a tale of true grit, salt air, and danger, with breaking waves, shallow sandbars, and shaky business deals to navigate against a backdrop of global politics, huge financial risk, and enormous economic expansion in a remote place called Alaska, where brown bears walk the beaches, volcanoes are still active, and whales swim out to look at people. It's a dramatic account of plant fires, flooded galleys, plane crashes, pistols and bags stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The stories are told by those who pioneered the fisheries, bucked the political tides, built the Alaska seafood industry, and literally risked their lives to do it. </p></p><p><p>The book was written by John van Amerongen, who served as editor in chief of the <i>Alaska Fisherman's JOURNAL </i>for 22 years prior to joining Trident as communications specialist and chief sustainability officer. Working as a commercial fisherman and professional shipwright during the '70s and early '80s, he learned the nuts, bolts, hooks and lines of the industry firsthand. As editor of the <i>AFJ</i>, he became a scholar of North Pacific fisheries management, politics, and personalities as he chronicled the Americanization of the industry following the passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and implementation of the 200-mile limit. </p> <p>As van Amerongen writes in his introduction to the book, <i>Catching a Deckload of Dreams </i>offers readers the rare opportunity to sit at the table with Chuck Bundrant as he swaps stories with the cornerstones of this remarkable company and industry. Anyone remotely interested in wild seafood or Alaska should pull up a chair. This is a seat well worth taking. </p></p><h2>Can You Guess Where We&#39;re Going?</h2><p>As his grandfather gives him hints about all the exciting things they will see, Jack, who loves spending the day with Gramps, tries to guess where they are going.</p><p>Cynthia Fisher has illustrated &#34;Can You Guess Where We&#39;re Going?&#34; by Elvira Woodruff and other books for young readers.

Kennedy Book Award, this is the most comprehensive book ever written about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Based on more than 700 interviews with all of King's surviving associates, as well as with those who opposed him, and enhanced by the author's access to King's personal papers and tens of thousands of pages of FBI documents, this is a towering portrait of a man's metamorphosis into a legend. Garrow traces King's transformation from a young, earnest pastor of a modest church into the foremost spokesperson of the black freedom struggle. The book's central unifying theme is King's growing awareness of the symbolic meaning of the cross as his sense of mission deepened, matured, and was transmuted by sometimes-reluctant degrees into acceptance of a life and a role that would end by demanding the ultimate in self-sacrifice. This is a powerful portrait of a man at the epicenter of one of the most dramatic periods in our history.</p></p><p>In this 1987 Pulitzer Prize winner, David J. Garrow, through extensive interviews, and access to F.B.I. transcripts, delves deeply into both Dr. Martin Luther King&#x2019;s leadership role and his private life. He attributes King's moral and physical courage to his religious faith: King believed that he had literally been called to do the Lord's work. But from 1965, when the F.B.I. taped King in sexual encounters and sent the tape to S.C.L.L. headquarters, his associates noted a "spiritual depression", even a "death wish." Fear that exposure would ruin his public work dogged him until his assassination in 1968. While documenting the F.B.I.'s dirty tricks, Garrow never loses sight of King's achievement and vision, nor of the poignancy of King's belief that "the cross is something that you bear and ultimately that you die on."e Pulitzer Prize. Based on more than 700 recorded conversations, including interviews with all of King&#39;s closest surviving associates, this is a powerful portrait of King and the movement for which he dedicated himself.</p><h2>McLuhan Hot and Cool: A Primer for the Understanding of McLuhan</h2><p>Softback, ex-library, with usual stamps and markings, in good all round condition.</p><p></p><h2>Hot Night in the City</h2><p>A collection of short stories presents a parade of characters in compelling situations--a young madman charms his trusting victims, two Basque women battle over an apple tree, and an embittered soldier rescues the dignity of a faded whore</p><p>TREVANIAN is the best-selling author of <i>The Main, The Eiger Sanction, The Summer of Katya, </i>and <i>Shibumi</i>. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages.Wide-ranging in setting and tone, yet linked by their sense of irony and reverence for the past, these 13 short stories reflect in miniature the pseudonymous Trevanian's chameleonic career as a genre-defying author of popular fiction (Shibumi; Incident at Twenty-Mile). Most of the tales take place in pre- and post-WWII urban environments, most notably the title story, which features a lonely girl dressed up like June Allyson and a gentlemanly stalker who imitates Jimmy Stewart and W.C. Fields. Trevanian tells the story twice, the first version introducing the volume, the second ending it; each has a different denouement, but both are tragic. A similar period mustiness permeates "Snatch Off Your Cap, Kid!"Aan ode to the tramps and hobos of bygone days; "After Hours at Rick's," an evocation of the timeless, edgy ennui of last call at a pick-up bar; and "The Sacking of Miss Plimsoll," the story of an unusual relationship between a bestselling author and his literary secretary. Basque country serves as the backdrop for two of Trevanian's tales: a young couple come together in a light romantic farce entitled "The Engine of Fate," and a village idiot improves his lot in life by pretending that he has a fortune to bequeath in "That Fox-of-a-Be?at." The author ventures even farther afield with "Easter Story," set in ancient Rome and detailing Pontius Pilate's first meeting with Jesus, and with a retelling of the wise and witty Onondaga creation parable "How the Animals Got Their Voices." Though he employs a number of hoary devices to achieve his effects, Trevanian can be an engaging storyteller, with a knack for getting inside his characters' heads. Several tales get bogged down when his narrative style turns pedantic, but the collection as a whole is enjoyable, if vaguely anachronistic.

We all looked up from our coffee and cigarettes, waffles, sausage and hash browns. She stood on her tiptoes to take a seat on a counter stool, picked up a menu and held it close to her face, like one of the 6 a.m. retirees without his bifocals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy, the night shift waitress, looked at me and raised her eyebrows. I knew the look; she gave it to me four or five times a week. It meant, <i>Do you think I should call the cops?<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered the idea. The girl looked no more than twelve, black, slim, but composed. Her hair was platted so tight I wondered if they tugged at her eyebrows. Her perfume, spicy with a hint of sandalwood, cut through the onion and batter odors of the diner. She wore clean, well-fitted jeans, a pink fuzzy sweater over a lime green top, and new-looking Nikes. Gold chain, oversized plastic watch. Not enough clothes for February.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She displayed no fear or uncertainty, which struck me as odd. Twelve-year-olds are always uncertain around adults.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to look outside. The day manager had finally replaced the broken lights in the lot, so our cars were brightly lit. There were none I didn&#x2019;t recognize, and I would recognize a new one. I&#x2019;d been running into the same people at the same hour of the night for almost three years, and had come to know them by their cars, the sound of their nasal congestion, and their bathing habits. We rarely spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What you doing here this time of morning?&#x201d; Sandy asked the girl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for the atmosphere,&#x201d; the girl said, keeping her nose in the menu. The sarcasm in her voice sounded bitter as a fifty-year-old&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy looked at me again. This time she was asking me if it would be okay if she dumped a pot of hot coffee on the girl&#x2019;s head. Sandy&#x2019;s skin got pretty thin by 3 a.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head. &#x201c;The lady&#x2019;s just trying to be friendly,&#x201d; I said to the girl. &#x201c;No need to be rude.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other regulars stared at their plates and cups, but I could tell their ears were locked in, the same way they had been a couple of weeks before when the place was held up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mind your own business, old man.&#x201d; The girl pronounced it <i>bidness.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy laughed. She knew the &#x201c;old man&#x201d; would piss me off. &#x201c;I like that, Tim. From now on I&#x2019;m calling you &#x2018;old man.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You suppose you could take my order?&#x201d; the girl said to her. Not a hint of a smile to soften her words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;cha want, honey?&#x201d; Sandy said. &#x201c;Lucky Charms? Count Chocula?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Two waffles, hash browns smothered and covered, coffee with cream, bacon, crisp.&#x201d; She folded the menu and stuck it back in the chrome holder next to the napkins.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy didn&#x2019;t write it down. &#x201c;You got money, honey?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl shook her head in disgust, reached two fingers into her back pocket, pulled out a Visa card, and flashed it toward Sandy like she was trying to blind her with a hand mirror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy rolled her eyes toward me but turned to the grill. Otilio had gone outside for a cigarette ten minutes ago, but this time of night, it often took him forty-five minutes. His girl, who worked at the Wal-Mart next door, took her break about then as well, and they liked to pooch up in his old Chevy van.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show apparently over, I returned to my book, the last one Ed McBain wrote before he passed. I read another ten pages and drank another half cup of coffee before I heard a car horn outside. I looked up to see a bright red Escalade parked as close to the front door as the curb would allow. Through the heavily tinted windshield I could make out the driver, a white man, bald, fortyish, tan coat with a thick white wool collar. His nose and right ear were pierced.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl seemed to expect the car. She made eye contact with the driver, smiled, pointed to her plate, and crammed a piece of bacon in her mouth. The rest of us stared at the car.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy opened the car door, slid off the seat and onto the curb. When he closed the door, I could see his beefy shoulders, leather pants, sharp-toed cowboy boots. He wore a Fu Manchu mustache that had overgrown his chin and hung loose like a couple of air roots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first pulled up, I&#x2019;d assumed daughter and grandfather, but she didn&#x2019;t appear to have any white blood, and he didn&#x2019;t show any black. Everyone but Sandy, the girl, and me stared down at their tabletops as the guy entered, probably sensing the same threat vibe I had. An old couple, Vernon and Viv, regulars&#x2014;she the western omelet woman, whole wheat toast, dry, he the pecan waffle, sugar-free syrup, two link sausages, decaf&#x2014;began buttoning up the layers of shirts and coats they wore until midsummer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man ignored us and walked to the girl&#x2019;s stool. She swiveled to face him, still chewing her toast. He leaned over until his mouth was at the level of her ear. I could hear him saying something, couldn&#x2019;t make out the words, but the tone sounded tense&#x2014;not commanding, not pleading, something in between.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy retreated behind the swinging door to the storage room and office and watched through the window in the door. When she saw me looking, she held up the cordless phone. She obviously sensed something wrong about the guy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shrugged my shoulders. I was slowly easing my way to the edge of my booth, my hand lightly holding the glass ketchup bottle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I shifted my weight, though, I could feel the stiffness in my knee. My shoulder, the one not completely fixed by surgery, creaked, and the roll of fat around my middle wedged me between the tabletop and the booth seat. And I had so much money tied up in my new bifocals that I couldn&#x2019;t afford to replace them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, if the girl had appeared frightened rather than pissy, if she&#x2019;d shrunk away from the man, if she&#x2019;d looked around for help, I&#x2019;d have stepped in. I&#x2019;m sure I would have helped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, she stood up, not looking at any of us. He pulled out the wallet chained to his belt and threw a ten on the counter. As she walked out he followed so close behind her it looked like they were glued together, back to chest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept his hand on her back as she climbed into the Escalade, shut the door behind her before getting in the driver&#x2019;s side. Before he drove off, he turned to me, winked, and gave me a two-finger salute from his temple, like a Boy Scout.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy wrote down the license plate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Should we call the cops?&#x201d; she said, refilling my coffee. I noticed her hand was shaking. Her hair, usually neatly pulled back and pinned with one of a variety of barrettes, had escaped and hung loosely on the shoulder of her yellow and black uniform.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Tony&#x2019;ll be here in half an hour,&#x201d; I said. Tony and his partner usually took their breakfast break about 5 every morning. We all felt comfortable when their cruiser was in the lot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy nodded. &#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t much older than Iris would have been.&#x201d; The comment caught me by surprise. Our daughter would have been twelve, but I carried a picture from Iris&#x2019;s eighth birthday party, so I tended to remember her as that age.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony stopped by a short time later with a cadet on ride-along, a fish-faced woman who couldn&#x2019;t sit still. She kept swinging on the counter stool. At this hour of the night, we saw a lot of speed freaks at the Waffle House, and cops weren&#x2019;t immune. Especially ones new to night shift.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony listened to our story, took the license plate info, and handed it to the cadet. She returned to the cruiser to call it in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony worked on his waffle and bacon, chatting quietly with Sandy. I figured they were working their way toward a half-assed affair. I&#x2019;d seen it before, from both of them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cadet returned a moment later, her hand resting on the grip of her pistol in its holster. She stared at Sandy until she walked away from Tony, picking up the coffeepot to take a refill swing through the dining room. Fishface then whispered in Tony&#x2019;s ear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered back, finished his coffee in a single gulp, and pulled a tablet and pen out of his breast pocket.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nobody leaves till we talk to you, okay?&#x201d; he said to the room in general.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young guy in the corner who spent every night muttering and writing in a ratty spiral notebook muttered a little faster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony told us the girl had been spotted jumping out of the Escalade at a light at the Hague Road exit to the freeway, on the other side of Columbus. The driver chased her on foot to the top of the overpass. Just as he was about to grab her, she jumped over the railing and landed on the freeway right in front of an eighteen-wheeler hauling corn syrup. From the timing, the whole thing, from the time they left, must have been a matter of half an hour. After the cops finished questioning us, I stayed to help Sandy make some closed signs. Since Waffle House never closes, they don&#x2019;t have any. The front door lock, seldom used, wouldn&#x2019;t work, so we wedged a ladder under the door handle to hold the door closed and left via the back door, the one that had a working lock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked her to her car, a ratty old Escort. I gave her a half-assed hug, which she tolerated. My roommate, a Mexican guy that had answered my local roommate-wanted ad, worked days at the local brake replacement place, so he was still asleep when I arrived back at the house. He yipped and muttered in his sleep, one reason I spent my nights at the House. I turned up the television until I could hear Katie Couric over his snores.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept like shit, which I always do when I&#x2019;m sober. It had been almost three years since my last sound night&#x2019;s sleep. The girl was still on my mind when I woke later that afternoon. I surfed the television for news until my roomie arrived home from work. He went by the nickname Texaco, which fit since he wore ostentatious cowboy boots tooled with pictures of rattlesnakes and longhorn steers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, the extent of our usual conversation, since he didn&#x2019;t speak much English. He carried a plastic gallon jug of milk out the back door onto the landing, where I heard him light a cigarette. He spent hours leaning on the railing, watching dumpsters and alley cats, drinking milk from the jug.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got nothing off the TV, so I dressed and walked next door to the library to use their computer and Internet access.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the web edition of the<i> Columbus Dispatch,</i> the girl&#x2019;s name was Nancilee Harper. Local girl, city school, basketball player. An angel, but aren&#x2019;t they all, when they&#x2019;re dead? No parents mentioned. Her grandmother&#x2019;s picture was up on the home page, a pencil-thin black woman with carrot-orange hair and a bombed-out look in her eyes; maybe they caught her on the way home from the clubs. She looked younger than me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the lead story, Nancilee had no enemies. She attended the Baptist church on the east edge of downtown. Good grades. She&#x2019;d been asleep upstairs when Grandma left that evening for work. Grandma, Phara Johnson, waited tables at Caddy&#x2019;s, a near eastside dive. Grandma returned home at 7 a.m. to find her front yard full of cops and reporters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mention of the white guy, the Escalade, no artist&#x2019;s sketch of a person of interest. I figured he was in the can already or two states away with his pedal to the floor. The license plate we&#x2019;d written down was no doubt in a dumpster somewhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I signed off and drifted to the magazine room. I never knew what to do with myself late afternoon, early evening, the time when families would be regathering after school, work, errands, fighting for the remote, doing homework, arguing about dinner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My disability check didn&#x2019;t cover entertainment, so the library was my second most frequented haunt. I was sitting by the picture window reading the latest <i>Popular Science</i> when Sandy called.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You see the news?&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The girl? Nancilee?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I knew she was leaning against the door frame in the hallway between her kitchen and dining room, probably twisting her index finger through the phone cord. She never sat down when she talked on the phone. I once asked her why. She told me her father used to sneak up behind her, take up some slack from the cord, and pull it around her neck like a garrote. All in fun, he&#x2019;d said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We should&#x2019;ve called.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t have known,&#x201d; I said. An old man across the table, holding a copy of <i>Home and Garden</i> an inch from his face, pulled it down to glare at me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ignored him. &#x201c;She went with that guy like she wasn&#x2019;t worried.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call on that girl&#x2019;s grandma. It&#x2019;s the least I can do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. You don&#x2019;t have anything to tell her that would be a comfort to her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;d want to know,&#x201d; Sandy said, her voice rushed, breathy. &#x201c;I wanted to know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Talking to the EMTs only made it worse for you.&#x201d; One EMT had told Sandy he thought I had alcohol on my breath. That one off-the-cuff remark had driven a stake through our marriage. I never realized when I was a kid that every day of your life is a high-wire act. Twenty years you can say the right thing, and then <i>pow</i>&#x2014;one casual comment, one inattentive moment, and you&#x2019;re in freefall. Ask Karl Wallenda.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you go with me?&#x201d; Sandy said. &#x201c;In an hour or so?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Tex walk out of our apartment building toward his Civic. He was dressed to kill, clothes tight and shiny, the silver on his belt buckle sparkling under the streetlights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed to go with Sandy. Not because I wanted to, but because I couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to do. I was also perversely drawn to pain, and I assumed there would be plenty there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked through my closet for something more formal than blue jeans. I considered my black suit but decided it might suggest I was claiming grief I didn&#x2019;t deserve, as I&#x2019;d only met the victim that one time. I settled on gray slacks, a dark green checked shirt, and a black sport coat, no tie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy picked me up twenty minutes later. The temperature had dropped back into the twenties, and the heater in her car was broken, but she wore only a thin overcoat. Her teeth were chattering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Where are your gloves?&#x201d; I asked as I pulled the door shut and belted myself in. I had given her a nice pair of kid leather gloves for Christmas a couple of months before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled away from the curb right i...</p><h2>Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft</h2><p>The phenomenal success of Bill Gates and his Microsoft Corporation hinges, above all, on an ability to look to the future. Not content with holding a bulging share of the market for software applications, nor with dominating the crucial operating systems business by virtue of its DOS and Windows programs, Microsoft is always looking to the future. And the future for Microsoft now goes by the name of Windows NT. A software innovation of the first order, NT could redefine the standards for computing throughout the world, into the next century. NT endows inexpensive personal computers with the capabilities of giant mainframes -- yet without sacrificing the inherent flexibility and appeal of PCs. Showstopper! is the inside story of this stunning breakthrough in computer technology. Stripping away myth after myth, this unprecedented tale lays bare the messy, wrenching reality of winning innovations. To date, America has dominated the global software industry through creating cutting-edge code and by depending on both the ingenuity of a few visionaries and the coordination of huge, costly teams of programmers and testers. Gates -- a managerial genius as well as a technical visionary -- promotes an atmosphere of controlled chaos at Microsoft, and the story of Windows NT perfectly reflects this ethos. The brain-child of David Cutler, a legendary programmer recruited by Gates in 1988, NT took five years and $150 million to complete. For much of that time, the massive program demanded the obsessive attention of more than 200 testers, writers and technicians. Focusing on Cutler&#39;s mercurial ability to inspire and lash his team, Showstopper! brilliantly portrays the human drama of this mammoth undertaking exposing the pressures, disappointments and ultimate triumph that emerge from a cauldron of constant deadlines, competition with peers and a perpetual war against the inevitable and ubiquitous bugs in the program -- among them the potentially lethal &#34;showstopper.&#34; Gripping vivid and accessible, Showstopper! reveals the outsize personalities that stand behind great advances: the mavericks, the organizers, the fixers, the motivators. Even as they wrestle with forces that threaten to tear them apart, Cutler and his team feverishly hunt for</p><p><i>Showstopper!</i> is a vivid account of the creation of Microsoft Windows NT, perhaps the most complex software project ever undertaken. It is also a portrait of David Cutler, NT's brilliant and, at times, brutally aggressive chief architect.<p> Cutler surely ranks as one of the most impressive software engineers the field has ever produced. After leading the team that created the VMS operating system for Digital's VAX computer line--an accomplishment that most would regard as a lifetime achievement--he went on to conceive and lead the grueling multi-year project that ultimately produced Windows NT. Both admired and feared by his team, Cutler would let nothing stand in the way of realizing his design and often clashed with his programmers, senior Microsoft management, and even Gates himself. Yet no matter how involved he became in managing his 100-programmer team, he continued to immerse himself in every technical detail of the project and write critical portions of the code himself.</p><p> <i>Showstopper!</i> is also a fascinating look at programmer and managerial culture behind the Microsoft facade. The portraits of the men and women who created NT not only reveal the brilliance of their work but the crushing stress and the dislocating effects that new wealth had on their lives. For some team members, the NT project ultimately destroyed their marriages, friendships, and virtually every human relationship outside of work. <i>Showstopper!</i> also reveals the uncertainties, false starts, and blind alleys that dogged the project as Microsoft repositioned NT from an improved OS/2 to something that would ultimately challenge both OS/2 and Unix for the title of the world's most powerful operating system.</p><b>G.

Rebelling against the aimless drinking, punishing missionary school, narrow strictures for women, and violence and hopelessness of reservation life, she joined the new movement of tribal pride sweeping Native American communities in the sixties and seventies and eventually married Leonard Crow Dog, the movement&#39;s chief medicine man, who revived the sacred but outlawed Ghost Dance.Mary Crow Dog narrates the story of her youth in this anguished account of growing up Indian in America. After participating in AIM (the new American Indian Movement), she joined the stand-off at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where she gave birth to a [son]. Her marriage to Leonard Crow Dog, a medicine man who revived the sacred Ghost Dance, was a learning experience for her; she was assimilated into his family. Short, choppy sentences impart a sense that Mary Crow Dog is speaking directly to readers, and her story is startling in its intensity of feeling and its directness about the Indians' reliance on their heritage and religion. A unique account of a way of life unknown to most Americans, this pulls readers in and holds them. By no means a pretty account--the author is graphic in her accounts of drunkenness, lawlessness, killings, and drug use--the book is an important bridge to cultural understanding, and a volume that should be in every library. --Dorothy L.

It is always connected to a deep and invisible process of finding meaning in life through work.</p><p>In Thomas Moore&#x2019;s groundbreaking book <i>Care of the Soul</i>, he wrote of &#x201c;the great malady of the twentieth century...the loss of soul.&#x201d; That bestselling work taught readers ways to cultivate depth, genuineness, and soulfulness in their everyday lives, and became a beloved classic. Now, in <i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i>, Moore turns to an aspect of our lives that looms large in our self-regard, an aspect by which we may even define ourselves&#x2014;our work. The workplace, Moore knows, is a laboratory where matters of soul are worked out. <i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i> is about finding the right job, yes, and it is also about uncovering and becoming the person you were meant to be.<br><br>Moore reveals the quest to find a life&#x2019;s work in all its depth and mystery. All jobs, large and small, long-term and temporary, he writes, contribute to your life&#x2019;s work. A particular job may be important because of the emotional rewards it offers or for the money. But beneath the surface, your labors are shaping your destiny for better or worse. If you ignore the deeper issues, you may not know the nature of your calling, and if you don&#x2019;t do work that connects with your deep soul, you may always be dissatisfied, not only in your choice of work but in all other areas of life. Moore explores the often difficult process&#x2014;the obstacles, blocks, and hardships of our own making&#x2014;that we go through on our way to discovering our purpose, and reveals the joy that is our reward. He teaches us patience, models the necessary powers of reflection, and gives us the courage to keep going.<br><br><i>A Life&#x2019;s Work</i> is a beautiful rumination, realistic and poignant, and a comforting and exhilarating guide to one of life&#x2019;s biggest dilemmas and one of its greatest opportunities.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Moore is the author of <i>Care of the Soul,</i> which spent forty-six weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, and fifteen other books on deepening spirituality and cultivating the soul in every aspect of life.

He is one of the most gifted men I know: He&#x2019;s intelligent, has a great sense of humor, loves people and is loved by them, and is an excellent artist. But he can&#x2019;t hold down a job and doesn&#x2019;t know what to do with his life. He hates the torturous rhythm of finding a new career, quitting, and trying again. With a ready smile for the outside world, he&#x2019;s like the classic clown who beneath his happy face paint is desperately sad.<br><br>Many men and women are like my friend Scottie. They look relatively happy and get along on the surface of life, but deep down they despair of ever really feeling good about the work they do or believing that their lives have been worth living. They also know too well that unhappiness at work spills over into other areas of life. <br><br>The failure to find the right job or to enjoy the one you have creates a special kind of depression. A person may feel that her spirit has been crushed or perhaps never brought to the light of day. Some wonder why they feel so low and never connect their depression to work. In therapy they may be talking about marital difficulties or an addiction, and they are surprised when their counselor asks about their work. It seems they haven&#x2019;t thought much about work in relation to their emotions and the things that give meaning to their lives.<br><br>An opus is the lifelong process of getting life together and becoming a real person, and it is no coincidence that the word is also used for a musical composition or an artist&#x2019;s total production. You are also a work of art&#x2014;alchemists referred to the opus as the Art. You are the artistic designer of your own life, and it is the most important work you will ever do. You will produce things that will make you proud&#x2014;happy children, a good home, a well&#x2013;functioning society, and maybe even some decent art. You will become a unique person. Nothing is more beautiful or more valuable. But if that potential goes unrealized, you may despair about life in general. <br><br>C. G. Jung once wrote that creativity is an instinct, not an optional gift granted to a lucky few. If you don&#x2019;t find a way to be creative in life, that instinct goes repressed and frustrated. You feel its loss as a deflation, the spirit leaking out of your sense of self. You feel empty, disengaged, and unfulfilled.<br><br>The opus doesn&#x2019;t come into existence fully formed. It takes sweat and tears to go through the arduous process of finding yourself, establishing a good career, and making a life. It is especially difficult to achieve all this in a world that doesn&#x2019;t support such a deep, long&#x2013;term process. Most people don&#x2019;t think beyond the immediate need for money and a bearable job, and most companies don&#x2019;t worry much about the personal calling of their workers.<br><br>Today we may not fully appreciate the workplace as a laboratory where matters of soul are worked out. We tend to focus on literal concerns such as pay, product, and advancement, whereas developments in your work life deeply affect your sense of meaning. Doing what you love and having relationships at work that help you as a person can give you feelings of peace and satisfaction at home and in the family.<br><br>A recent study of how Americans feel about their work lives concluded that today people are generally happier with their jobs than they were thirty years ago, but they see their work as having a negative impact on life at home. Specifically, they are working longer hours and therefore have less time for their families, their health, and their hobbies. Modern technologies, such as e&#x2013;mail, blur the borders between work and home. Companies are also offering less in benefits and encouraging employees to work harder for profit sharing and stock ownership. The link between fulfillment at work and happiness at home is more important than ever.<br><br>My friend Scottie is a case in point. When I first got to know him, I saw a vibrant man full of talent. I envied him then and still do whenever I see him relaxed and congenial or showing our circle of friends his latest canvas. His talent and personality are extraordinary. I heard about his difficulties with work but thought that all he needed was to search around and find a business that recognized what an asset he would be to them. Naively I wrote a letter of reference for him, thinking that I might solve his problem at one stroke. At that time I looked at the surface of his life; today I&#x2019;d look deeper.<br><br>As time passed, I learned that he had other serious problems, that his family life, so serene on the outside, was apparently troubled and always on the edge of collapse. I was surprised to hear that he had trouble with alcohol dependency and that his occasional outbursts of rage made him feared at home and threatened his marriage. In social settings people are drawn to him like a magnet, but his private life is tragic.<br><br>Scottie is having serious trouble finding the right job, staying with the job he has been able to secure, and finding pleasure and fulfillment in what he does. And I mean serious trouble. He stands a good chance of losing an extraordinary partner in his gifted wife and three unusually creative and promising children.<br><br>Whatever the source of his problems may be, Scottie&#x2019;s troubled soul is focused now on his inability to find his life&#x2019;s work. He secures jobs that offer money and some satisfaction, but he still feels that he is in the wrong place. He gets so frustrated and angry that he distances himself from his family and his friends. He doesn&#x2019;t let anyone help him, and he can&#x2019;t seem to get to the root of his problem.<br><br>Scottie is like many people who try to solve the problem of work at a purely practical level: getting new training, trying new careers, and judging success by the size of the paycheck. In fact, the process of finding a job, doing the work, and dealing with the relationships at the workplace has deep roots in family, personal experience, and personality issues. To get to the bottom of serious frustration, you have to consider the whole picture: the past, as well as the present; your family&#x2019;s worldview and experience with work; and the personal issues you bring to the job.<br><br>In the ordinary job hunt you may be doing career testing and interviewing and experimenting with jobs, but to move toward your life work you have to work through the past, deep and raw emotions, and relationships that need attention. The roots of career problems run deep, and only a deep solution is effective in the long run.<br><br>If you have anything in common with Scottie, I would recommend stopping to look closely at the whole of your life. You will find in this book a long list of things to consider in the inventory of your life experience. Think of every aspect of your life as connected, and always go deeper than you think you need to go.<br><b>Stalled: The Feeling of Getting Nowhere</b><br><br>Frustration with work can take many forms. One complaint I frequently hear is the feeling of getting nowhere. Rose, the mother of one of my daughter&#x2019;s friends, has had an excellent education and comes across as an able and creative person. She has ability, intelligence, and a bright personality but still can&#x2019;t move ahead with her career. She tries one job after another, but they seem to be lateral moves. She isn&#x2019;t moving closer to where she wants to be. She feels stalled, stuck, and sometimes even as if she's moving backward.<br><br>These days one often hears a plea, expressed with humor or sadness, from men and women, old and young: &#x201c;What am I going to do with my life?&#x201d;or &#x201c;What am I going to be when I grow up?&#x201d;People in their fifties and sixties say this, meaning that they still don&#x2019;t know for sure who they are and what they are called to do. I have heard Rose say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m supposed to do with my life. All I know is that this isn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What am I going to be when I grow up?&#x201d;It&#x2019;s a telling remark, suggesting strongly that the person feels that she is still at the beginning of her life, perhaps even a child, immature, not having progressed as far as she should have. The laughter that accompanies the confession covers over concern and anxiety about the situation. &#x201c;Will I ever grow up? Will I ever succeed?&#x201d;<br><br>If I had such a person in therapy, I&#x2019;d want to explore the background of this important self&#x2013;image. Does it play a role in other parts of life? Does it have roots in the family and in early experience? Dealing with the issue outside of the specific work situation might help resolve both the deep emotional problem and the search for a life work.<br><br>My friend Scottie has apparently built up a pile of rage as well as depression over the years, knowing that he is capable of doing great things but never able to get a project off the ground. This gap between ambition and achievement can be painful to behold.

Of the 51 planes sent to attack Japanese carriers only 7 returned, and of the 127 aircrew only 29 survived. Not a single torpedo hit its target.<br>A story of avoidable mistakes and flawed planning, <i>The Unknown Battle of Midway </i>reveals the enormous failures that led to the destruction of four torpedo squadrons but were omitted from official naval reports: the planes that ran out of gas, the torpedoes that didn&#x2019;t work, the pilots who had never dropped torpedoes, and the breakdown of the attack plan. Alvin Kernan, who was present at the battle, has written a troubling but persuasive analysis of these and other little-publicized aspects of this great battle. The standard navy tactics for carrier warfare are revealed in tragic contrast to the actual conduct of the battle and the after-action reports of the ships and squadrons involved.<p></p></p><p><b>Alvin Kernan</b> is Avalon University Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, Princeton University. He served in the U.S. Navy, 1941 45. Among his previous books are <i>The Fruited Plain: Fables for a Postmodern Democracy </i>and <i>In Plato&#x2019;s Cave</i>, both published by Yale University Press.<p></p>Author of a notable war memoir (<i>Crossing the Line,</i> 1994), Kernan returns to1942's Battle of Midway, in which he was ordnance man on the aircraft carrier <i>Enterprise</i>. Considered the strategic turning point of the Pacific War, Midway is seen by military historians as an improbable American victory, one marred by the near-total annihilation of American torpedo bomber squadrons and whose story, Kernan remarks, has never been thoroughly studied. Because of the obsolescence of torpedo, or "Devastator," planes, mounting a coordinated strike was the pilots'only hope of survival, one that failed to materialize due to snafus that Kernan grimly but rivetingly relates. Attacking alone, the Devastators had the sacrificial effect of distracting Japanese fighter planes from dive bombers that eventually sank the Japanese carriers. "In the years since," Kernan writes, "this unintended action has become the official justification for the tragedy." Those justifications are the telling component in Kernan's autopsy, as he detects deceptions between the lines of after-action reports. An incisive and laconic writer, Kernan knows his facts and presents them with deep feeling. A World War II must-read. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh discovered dozens of skeletons, but in 1905, fossil hunter Barnum Brown named the first tyrannosaur known to science--<i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. </p><p><i>Tyrannosaurus</i> was an impressive beast; it topped five tons, was more than thirty-five feet (twelve meters) long, and had the largest head and most powerful bite of any land animal, ever. Tyrannosaurs started small, just a couple of yards long, and over the course of 100 million years, evolved into giant meat-slicing bone crushers. </p><p>As of 2015, there were nearly 30 described species of tyrannosaur, but during the last decade at least one new species has been identified and named every year, greatly improving what we know about how they lived, fed, bred, and died. THE TYRANNOSAUR CHRONICLES tracks the rise of these dinosaurs, and presents the latest research into their biology, showing off more than just their impressive statistics--tyrannosaurs had feathers, and fought and even ate one another. Indeed, David Hone tells the evolutionary story of the group through their anatomy, ecology, and behavior, exploring how they came to be the dominant terrestrial predators of the Mesozoic--and more recently, one of the great icons of biology.</p></p><p><b>David Hone </b>is rapidly becoming the "face" of dinosaur research. Based at Queen Mary University of London, he is a lecturer in ecology. He has published more than fifty academic papers on dinosaur biology and behavior, with a particular focus on tyrannosaurs. His fieldwork has included working on the famous feathered dinosaur deposits of China. His writing credits include the BBC&#x2019;s "Walking with Dinosaurs" and articles in New Scientist and The New York Times. He lives in London, England.Adored by children and adults alike, tyrannosaurus is the most famous dinosaur in the world, one that pops up again and again in pop culture, often battling other beasts such as King Kong, triceratops, or velociraptors in Jurassic Park. But despite the hype, tyrannosaurus and the other tyrannosaurs are fascinating animals in their own right and are among the best-studied of all dinosaurs. <br>Tyrannosaurs started small but over the course of 100 million years evolved into the giant carnivorous bone crushers that continue to inspire awe in palaeontologists, screenplay writers, sci-fi novelists and the general public alike. Tyrannosaurus itself was truly impressive; it topped six tons, was more than 12 meters (40 feet) long and had the largest head and most powerful bite of any land animal in history. <br>The Tyrannosaur Chronicles tracks the rise of these dinosaurs and presents the latest research into their biology, showing off more than just their impressive statistics - tyrannosaurs had feathers and fought and even ate each other. <br>This audiobook presents the science behind this research; it tells the story of the group through their anatomy, ecology and behaviour, exploring how they came to be the dominant terrestrial predators of the Mesozoic era and, in more recent times, one of the great icons of biology.<p><i>This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media.

Bill Dailey&#39;s talent as a horse-whisperer was unmatched in the days before the automobile and young Henry tells of an unscrupulous con-man who mistreats horses into behaving temporarily. Bill is determined to show that the man is a fraud, but can he unmask the con without getting hurt?Walter Farley experimented with many genres of writing and here, in his only foray into historical fiction, he weaves a fascinating tale of life when horses were the primary means of transportation.</p><p>Walter Farley wrote 21 books in the famous Black Stallion series. He died in 1989.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>A World of Horses<br><br>The old man's hair was as silver as the glistening wings of the plane; the youth's as red as the sun beyond the runway. The two of them stepped back quickly as the inboard engines caught, blasting the air. Above the even rumble the old man asked anxiously, "You're sure the Black's all right, Alec?"<br>"Positive, or I wouldn't have left him alone. When do we take off?"<br>"Not for a long while, I'm afraid. The chief mechanic said this is just routine preflight inspection. We're not goin' anywhere yet. We got trouble above."<br>"Trouble above?" Alec repeated wonderingly.<br>They looked at the sky together. It was soft, cloudless and empty.<br>"Traffic trouble, Alec. They've run out of air space."<br>"It doesn't look that way from down here."<br>"No, but they got avenues up there an' they go right across the Atlantic. They're jammed. The tower told the chief mechanic that a Pan Am and a TWA flight are coming in fifteen minutes apart. And there's a flight of air force jets behind 'em."<br>"You picked up a lot of information, Henry."<br>"I listen to 'em gab. They said it'll be at least two hours before we're cleared for takeoff."<br>"Imagine running out of air space," Alec said incredulously.<br>"Imagine bein' able to fly from Lisbon to New York in a matter of a few hours!" Henry echoed. "That's what gets me." His gaze returned to the airplane. Just a big hunk of metal going nowhere in particular, he mused--nowhere but across the Atlantic Ocean, or some two thousand miles of open water, carrying over three thousand gallons of gas and seventy thousand pounds of cargo, including them and their black horse. It was a fast-moving world, all right!<br>"I'm going back to the stable," Alec said.<br>"Me too. I'm more at home there," the old man replied.<br>Henry Dailey, who was in his sixty-second year of training and racing horses, followed Alec Ramsay around the airport administration building to a large livestock shed in the rear. He listened affectionately to the sounds of the penned and stabled animals. Most of them he recognized easily--the bawling calves, some pigs, an unhappy dog and of course the Black.<br>"But what's that chattering going on down at the far end?" he asked Alec.<br>"Monkeys," the boy answered. "They must have twenty of 'em in cages. Bound for U.S. zoos, the barn super said."<br>With the opening of his stall door the Black Stallion came forward quickly, his eyes alert and impatient.<br>"Not yet. Not yet, but soon," Alec told him softly.<br>The old trainer watched the Black dance in the straw, noting how much he favored his right forefoot. He had suffered a severe stone bruise in Europe and there'd be no racing him for a while. One didn't take chances with this kind of a horse. That's why they were going home.<br>Henry noted, too, that the famous stallion's coat shone as brightly as his eyes. While waiting for the plane's departure Alec had groomed him to within an inch of his life. His small ears were pricked, catching the strange sounds from the other animals. His fine head was held high. His every sense was alert. Every muscle, every sinew was ready to be unleashed with the power and swiftness of a coiled steel spring. The Black was all horse.<br>Nothing will ever take his place, the trainer thought. No multi-engined plane or jet, no rocket or missile or spaceship. There's always been need for a fine horse. There always will be. Or am I just an old fool to go on thinking so?<br>Henry Dailey bent down to the straw, carefully picking up the horse's injured foot. How many thousands of feet have I picked up, I wonder? he asked himself. How many thousands of days and nights have I spent at it? Someday he might figure it out. Just for the laughs.<br>Alec asked anxiously, "It's better, isn't it, Henry?"<br>"You asked me that only this morning," the trainer replied brusquely. "It's no better, Alec, no better at all. An injury like this takes time to heal. You got to be patient."<br>"I am patient," Alec said quickly, sensitive to the old man's sharp criticism. "I've got time, plenty of time . . . so has he. I was just asking."<br>Henry put down the Black's foot. "Have a seat then," he said more kindly, patting the straw beside him, "and let's stop rushin' from country to country an' from race to race. It's snug an' warm here and we have a fine horse to look at. What more could we want?"<br>"There!" Alec said, dropping to the straw beside the old man. "This is the life, all right," he agreed, laughing easily because he was very content.<br>"Yep, and I want to tell you a little more about this kind of life. It just might be that horses are goin' out of fashion." Henry's eyes weren't on Alec but on the oval-shaped hoofs buried in the straw. "Some of the things that have happened to horses might be forgotten with the world movin' fast like it is."<br>A strange, excited note came into the old man's voice as he asked suddenly, "Did you ever hear of a professional horse-tamer, Alec?"<br>"Trainer, you mean, Henry? Like you are?"<br>"No, Tamer."<br>"No, then. Lion-tamer, yes. Horse-tamer, no. Did he use a long whip and snap it in a ring?" Alec asked with attempted lightness.<br>"Sometimes," Henry answered seriously. "The whip was one of the tools of his trade and occasionally he had good use for it. There was a need for such men just before the turn of the century. The big trouble was that there weren't enough of them to go around. Most everybody had a horse, y'know. It was about the only way of gettin' from place to place. Yet few owners knew anything about horses except how to ride or drive 'em. When trouble arose, it was hard on both man and horse. That's when they started lookin' around for a horse-tamer."<br>Henry paused and Alec said, "They could have called him a trainer. A tamer makes you think of wild animals."<br>"Training takes time, Alec, as you know, and these men had no time. They did a job in a matter of hours--a few days at most--and then went on to the next case. Some of the horses, too, were worse than wild animals--vicious, mean horses. Most often, of course, they were the result of bad handling by their owners. But come to think of it, what kind of a job would you and I do on that plane outside? We're no mechanics and, as I say, so many owners in the old days weren't horsemen. They just needed a horse to get around. They made mistakes, plenty of 'em--and they suffered for it. So did their horses."<br>Alec chewed thoughtfully on a piece of straw. He was beginning to understand what Henry was getting at. He could imagine thousands upon thousands of horses developing bad habits and vices, most of them going from bad to worse because their owners had no professional ability or help. One horse kicked; a second balked; a third pulled against the bit and ran away; a fourth would not stand still to wait or to be shod or to be mounted; another would not back up; still others would bite or rear or throw themselves over backwards or refuse to work. Then again they would be afraid of umbrellas, blankets, carts, wagons, cows, baby carriages or something else. With all this happening in crowded city streets where horses were the sole means of transportation, people could be hurt or killed and property destroyed.<br>"Were you ever a horse-tamer?" Alec asked Henry.<br>"No, but my oldest brother was. I watched him at it. He was good."<br>"How good?"<br>"One of the best," the old man answered, his eyes bright with memories. "Bill was about thirty, I guess, when my father sent me off one summer to live with him. That was back in Pennsylvania. I was just a kid but not too young to learn a trade. . . ."<br>"You mean that horse-taming trade?"<br>"No, not that. Bill wasn't in it then. He was a carriage-maker and a good one." Henry laughed. "I remember that he always called me Hank an' I didn't like the nickname at all."<br>"So you became a carriage-maker," Alec commented.<br>"Not at all. Turned out that I didn't learn a thing about carriage making. I remember that first day pretty well. We were deliverin' a new buggy Bill had just finished to a Mr. Murray. . . ."<br>And then Henry went on with the story.</p><h2>Lord Emsworth&#39;s Annotated Whiffle</h2><p>Lord Emsworth&#39;s &#34;bible on the pig&#34;, a book he and his pigman studied assidiously, was a massive work by Augustus Whiffle which explained in great detail the care and management of the pig.

The protagonist is a 40-year-old New Yorker named Nona who thinks too much of and about herself. She ruins a perfectly decent marriage for a lousy affair and then wonders where she went wrong. She has other concerns, both past and present, that create pictures of one woman and--through her eyes--of those around her.The promise Nunez revealed in her acclaimed 1995 debut, A Feather on the Breath of God, is here fulfilled and magnified, as she follows the struggles of a woman to know her father and understand herself, labors that imperil her once secure marriage. Nona, little loved as a child and a pill-dependent insomniac as an adult, has found a measure of happiness hitherto unknown in her five-year marriage to Roy, with whom she shares a love of music and New York City life. Trouble erupts, however, during a monthlong visit to a friend's country estate, to which she retreats to work on a book about her father--an artist long dead, but out of her life even before that--when she meets brooding, handsome English prof Lyle and inexplicably finds herself opening up to him. He swamps her with love letters when they return to their respective homes, until she decides to visit him for a weekend in Tucson. His passion proves to have been written with disappearing ink, but back in New York, Nona finds that her marriage has slipped its moorings in her absence: She and Roy separate with rapidly dwindling hopes of reconciliation. In despair, she picks up the book project again, contacting her father's last lover, a man, who warms to her and reveals a side of daddy she never knew. She draws some comfort from her emerging knowledge of her father. Yoga and meditation, along with a dog, also provide comfort, enabling her to cope with a near- miss from breast cancer, and when Ray proposes a honeymoon they never had, she finds herself ready, tentatively, to begin again--a decision sorely tested when yet another unexpected disaster disrupts their lives. No dazzling, high-powered dynamics here, but, rather, a steady, superbly insightful study of a life as quietly complex as the reader's own: a tale that touches the heart of what it is to be human.

It is indeed very long, the longest country in Europe outside Scandinavia and the Ukraine. It is also one of the thinnest, its peninsula about as narrow as Portugal and the Netherlands, broader only than Albania and Luxembourg. Ugo La Malfa, a republican politician of the twentieth century, liked to picture the country as a man with his feet in Africa and his hands clutching the Alps, trying to pull himself up into the middle of Europe.1We think of Italy as a country with a north and a south, but actually its 720 miles run diagonally through different climatic and vegetation zones from the town of Aosta in the north-west, where French is an official language, to the Salentine Peninsula in the Apulian south-east, where Greek is still spoken. On the battlements of the Castle of Otranto you feel you are in the Balkans, and in a sense you are: you can see the mountains of Greece and Albania across the water; you are closer to Istanbul and the Ukraine than you are to Aosta; the Black Sea is nearer than the west coast of Sardinia. When Apulia joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the new state's capital was Turin, a city so far away that Otranto is today closer to seventeen foreign capitals than it is to Turin. No wonder you sometimes hear Apulians refer to themselves as Greeks or Levantines. Sometimes they pretend that they are not also Italians.In 1847 the Austrian chancellor, Prince Metternich, dismissed Italy as '<i>une expression g�ographique</i>', a remark that has subsequently succeeded in annoying many people, especially Italians and historians. At the time Italy may have been more than a geographical expression - thoughit was still divided into eight independent states - but Metternich was repeating a view widely held for more than 2,000 years: Italy, like Iberia, may have been a geographical unit with natural borders but it had not been united since Roman times and did not seem to require political unity now or in the future.Italy seems to begin with the myth of Hercules, the Greek hero who rescued a stray calf that had wandered across southern Italy and swum the Straits of Messina. The land the animal crossed duly became known as Italia, from the word <i>ouitoulos</i> or bull-calf, a word that has also bequeathed us, via Oscan and Latin, the word <i>vitello</i> or veal. A related theory, recorded by the Greek historian Timaeus, held that the ancient Greeks had been so impressed by the cattle in Italy that they had rewarded the land with the same name.This may be the explanation for the origin of the name 'Italia', but it does not seem quite convincing. For centuries northern visitors have been scathing about the skinny appearance of Italian cows, especially the small, white, wide-horned ones bred mainly for pulling carts and drawing ploughs. The arid south of the peninsula, bereft of pasture and hay fields, can hardly have seemed a herdsman's paradise even for the Greeks: the great Murge Plateau in Apulia cannot support cattle because it does not have streams. Italy today has to import more than half the milk it consumes and, if we associate the south with any kind of cattle now, it is with water buffaloes, producers of the milk used in making the soft white cheese <i>mozzarella di b�fala</i>. Yet the buffaloes are of Asian origin and were brought to Italy for ploughing in the early Middle Ages; later they went wild, roaming over Campania and the Pontine Marshes before they were domesticated once more in the eighteenth century. Used as draught animals rather than for milk and meat, the herds seemed to be dying out in the first half of the twentieth century. Their famous product did not become either famous or fashionable until the 1980s.In the fifth century BC the word 'Italia' applied only to the Calabrian toe of the Italian 'boot', which was inhabited by a people known as the Bruttians. Later it was extended to Lucania and Campania, and later still the term spread northwards to describe Rome's conquests in the peninsula. The Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides did not regard the land beyond the River Po as a part of Italy, and indeedgeographically the Po Valley belongs to the continental land-mass not the peninsula. But after the Romans had subdued its Gallic tribes and reached the Alps, that area too was added to Italia. By the second century BC another Greek historian, Polybius, confirmed that almost the whole of modern Italy was then Italia, though Roman poets of a later age sometimes called it by other names such as Hesperia, Ausonia, Saturnia terra and (appropriately for what is now the largest wine producer in the world) Oenotria, 'the land of wine'.There was one sharp check to this progress. In 91 BC some of Rome's <i>socii</i> (subservient allies) rebelled and set up a state in the central Apennines called Italia, with a capital Corfinium (renamed Italica), administered by praetors, a senate and two consuls. The insurgents even produced coins showing the bull of Italia goring and about to rape the Roman wolf. They were defeated, however, in the ensuing Social War by Rome's traditional tactic of brutality plus concessions, and no further attempt was made to set up a state called Italy for many centuries to come.Within a century of the war, the earlier version of Italia was organized as an administrative unit by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, who divided it into eleven districts; the Istrian Peninsula, which was joined to Venetia, was the only part that does not belong to the modern state of Italy.a A later emperor, Diocletian, expanded Italia to include Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and Raetia, a district that contained parts of what are now Switzerland, Bavaria and the Tyrol.Augustan Italy, lauded by Virgil and his fellow poets, remained an inspiration to the poets of the Middle Ages, to Petrarch who sang of 'the fair land / That the Apennines divide and the sea and the Alps surround',2 and to many others later on. Yet until the end of the eighteenth century Italy remained a literary idea, an abstract concept, an imaginary homeland or simply a sentimental urge. If at times people used it to express resentment at foreign occupation, its independence and unity were not political aspirations. And for a large majority of the population it meant nothing at all. Even in 1861, at the time of unification, some Sicilians thought L'Italia - or rather la Talia - was their new queen. A full century later, the social reformer Danilo Dolciencountered Sicilians who had never heard of Italy and asked him what it was.3&nbsp;<br>The geography we imbibe from school textbooks and atlases makes us think that Italy is peculiarly blessed in its position. According to the revolutionary patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, God had given Italians 'the most clearly demarcated fatherland in Europe'.4 There it lies in the centre of the Mediterranean, protected in the north by its Alpine ramparts and everywhere else by its seas.Italy is actually extremely unfortunate in its position, which has made it one of the most easily and frequently invaded places in the world. The Alps may look impressive but they have been penetrated without difficulty since the Bronze Age. In the twelfth century BC traders were bringing amber from the Baltic across the Alps to Etruria and Sardinia; by the Roman era seventeen of the twenty-three Alpine passes were being used. Few ramparts have been so consistently surmounted down the centuries. Hannibal brought his Carthaginian army over the Western Alps, while Alaric's Goths and Attila's Huns came from the east through the lower Julian and Carnic Alps. In 1796 General Bonaparte, as he then was, marched through the Maritime Alps between Nice and Genoa - allowing him to boast to his soldiers, '<i>Annibal a forc� les Alpes - nous, nous les avons tourn�s' -</i> but four years later, now as first consul, he descended on Italy through five more northerly passes. Afterwards he had himself painted riding a white charger through the snows of the Great St Bernard, though in fact he had been led through them on a little grey mule.Many other aggressors have emulated these invaders of Italy. Once they had got through the passes and on to the plain, they could speed up across the Po Valley, which was flat, inviting and difficult to defend, unless they were attacking from the west, in which case they were hindered by tributaries of the Po flowing southwards in parallel from the northern lakes: Milan was simple to capture, and those other 'gateways' to Italy, Turin and Verona, were not much harder. One reason why the eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) lasted for a thousand years longer than its western counterpart was that it was much easier to defend. The Goths and Huns might rampage around the Balkans but they were halted at Constantinople by the city walls and a fleetthat prevented then from crossing the Bosphorus and ravaging Asia Minor. Later the Byzantines performed a similar feat in reverse, blocking the Arabs in the seventh century and thus preventing them from pouring into eastern Europe, reaching Italy and doubtless islamicizing Rome. At a time, a century before Charlemagne, when Europe was militarily weak, Byzantium saved it and made possible its later rise to dominance. Apart from the French Riviera, the Italian peninsula has the only Mediterranean coasts that (except around Bari) have never been Muslim.Its seas made Italy even more vulnerable than its mountains. With 4,500 miles of coastline, the peninsula and its islands are almost impossible to patrol. They can be attacked from all directions by predators from three continents.Boats were man's first means of transport, and by 5000 BC these had become sufficiently sturdy to undertake long sea voyages. In the fifth century BC Herodotus observed that a boat could sail 75 miles in twenty-four hours, a statistic suggesting that invaders of Italy from...</p><h2>Daddy Long Legs</h2><p>An anonymous benefactor offers to pay for the education of seventeen-year-old Jerusha Abbott, the oldest orphan at the John Grier Home</p><p>Alice Jane Chandler Webster wrote under the pseudonym of Jean Webster. She was an American author and wrote many books. Besides writing short stories, she also wrote stage-adaptations of her novels."Blue Wednesday"<br><br> The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," whenever a Trustee spoke.<br><br> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line toward the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.<br><br> Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.<br><br> The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring "Home" to the driver. But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.<br><br> Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.<br> Je-ru-sha Ab-bott You are wan-ted In the of-fice, And I think you'd Better hurry up!<br> Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.<br><br> "Who wants me?" she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.<br> Mrs. Lippett in the office, And I think she's mad. Ah-a-men!<br> Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.<br><br> Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had--O horrors!--one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F "sassed" a Trustee?<br><br> The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm toward an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked, for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.<br><br> Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.<br><br> "Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you."<br><br> Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.<br><br> "Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?"<br><br> "I saw his back."<br><br> "He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money toward the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown."<br><br> Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.<br><br> "This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely toward the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls."<br><br> "No, ma'am," Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.<br><br> "To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up."</p><h2>The Best 50 Biscotti Recipes</h2><p>These twice-baked favorites are surprisingly easy to make.

Nicholas Spencer, charismatic head of the medical research company Gen-stone, involved in the development of an anticancer vaccine, suddenly disappears. His private plane crashes en route to Puerto Rico, but his body is not found. Early results of the vaccine seemed highly promising. Yet, coinciding with Nicholas Spencer's disappearance comes news that the FDA is denying approval. Then follows the shocking revelation that Spencer had looted Gen-stone of huge sums of money -- including the lifetime savings of people who had risked every penny they had. Marcia "Carley" DeCarlo, the thirty-two-year-old columnist for the <i>Wall Street Weekly,</i> is assigned to cover the story. Carley is the stepsister of Spencer's wife, Lynn, an aggressive PR woman and socialite, whom she dislikes and distrusts. The day after news of her husband's disappearance rocks the financial and medical world, Lynn attends a meeting of the stockholders of Gen-stone, flaunting expensive clothing and jewelry. Accused of having participated in the scam, she appears indifferent to the anger and despair of the people attending, among them a man whose child has cancer and who is now about to lose his home. That night, she narrowly escapes death when her mansion in Bedford, New York, is set on fire. She turns to Carley, begging her to use her investigative skills to prove that she was not her husband's accomplice. As Carley proceeds with her investigation, she is confronted by seemingly impenetrable questions: Is Nicholas Spencer dead or in hiding? Was he guilty or set up? Why the sudden reversal in medical opinion of the vaccine from recognition to condemnation? And as the facts begin to unfold, she becomes the target of a dangerous group involved in a sinister and fraudulent scheme. <i>The Second Time Around</i> is Mary Higgins Clark at her best, telling a story that intertwines fiction with the stuff of real-life headlines in a novel of breathtaking suspense and surprises.</p><p><b>Mary Higgins Clark</b>'s books are world-wide bestsellers.

It was an unseasonably cold and wintry day, but suitably bleak considering the circumstances. The headline two weeks earlier that Nicholas Spencer, president and chief operating officer of Gen-stone had been killed in the crash of his private plane while flying to San Juan had been greeted with genuine and heartfelt grief. His company expected to receive the blessing of the Food and Drug Administration for a vaccine that would both eliminate the possibility of the growth of cancer cells and bring to a halt the progression of the disease in those already afflicted -- a preventive and a cure that he alone was responsible for bringing to the world. He named the company "Gen-stone," a reference to the Rosetta stone that had unveiled the language of ancient Egypt and allowed the appreciation of its remarkable culture. </p><p> The headline proclaiming Spencer's disappearance was followed in short order by the announcement from the chairman of the board of Gen-stone that there had been numerous setbacks in the experiments with the vaccine and that it could not be submitted to the FDA for approval in the foreseeable future. The announcement further said that tens of millions of dollars had been looted from the company, apparently by Nicholas Spencer. </p><p> I'm Marcia DeCarlo, better known as Carley, and even as I sat in the roped-off media section at the stockholders' meeting, observing the furious or stunned or tearful faces around me, I still had a sense of disbelief in what I was hearing. Apparently Nicholas Spencer, <i>Nick,</i> was a thief and a fraud. The miracle vaccine was nothing more than the offspring of his greedy imagination and consummate salesmanship. He had cheated all these people who had invested so much money in his company, often their life savings or total assets. Of course they hoped to make money, but many believed as well that their investment would help make the vaccine a reality. And not only had investors been hurt, but the theft had made worthless the retirement funds of Gen-stone's employees, over a thousand people. It simply didn't seem possible. </p><p> Since Nicholas Spencer's body had not washed ashore along with charred pieces of his doomed plane, half the people in the auditorium didn't believe he was dead. The other half would willingly have driven a stake through his heart if his remains had been discovered. </p><p> Charles Wallingford, the chairman of the board of Gen-stone, ashen-faced but with the natural elegance that is achieved by generations of breeding and privilege, struggled to bring the meeting to order. Other members of the board, their expressions somber, sat on the dais with him. To a man they were prominent figures in business and society. In the second row were people I recognized as executives from Gen-stone's accounting firm. Some of them had been interviewed from time to time in <i>Weekly Browser,</i> the syndicated Sunday supplement for which I write a financial column. </p><p> Sitting to the right of Wallingford, her face alabaster pale, her blond hair twisted into a French knot, and dressed in a black suit that I'm sure cost a fortune, was Lynn Hamilton Spencer. She is Nick's wife -- or widow -- and, coincidentally my stepsister whom I've met exactly three times and whom I confess I dislike. Let me explain. Two years ago my widowed mother married Lynn's widowed father, having met him in Boca Raton where they lived in neighboring condominiums. </p><p> At the dinner the evening before the wedding, I was as annoyed by Lynn Spencer's condescending attitude as I was charmed by Nicholas Spencer. I knew who he was, of course. The stories about him in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> had been detailed. He was the son of a Connecticut family doctor, a general practitioner whose avocation was research biology. His father had a laboratory in his home, and from the time that Nick was a child, he spent most of his free time there, helping his dad with experiments. "Other kids had dogs," he had explained to interviewers. "I had pet mice. I didn't know it, but I was being tutored in microbiology by a genius." He had gone the business route, getting an MBA in business management with the plan of owning a medical supply operation someday. He started work at a small supply business and quickly rose to the top and became a partner. Then, as microbiology became the wave of the future, he began to realize that was the field he wanted to pursue. He began to reconstruct his father's notes and discovered that shortly before his sudden death his father had been on the verge of making a major breakthrough in cancer research. Using his medical supply company as a base, he set out to create a major research division. </p><p> Venture capital had helped him launch Gen-stone, and word of the cancer-inhibiting vaccine had made the company the hottest stock on Wall Street. Initially offered at $3 a share, the stock had risen as high as $160, and conditional on FDA approval, Garner Pharmaceutical contracted to pay $1 billion for the rights to distribute the new vaccine. </p><p> I knew that Nick Spencer's wife had died of cancer five years ago, that he had a ten-year-old son, and that he'd been married to Lynn, his second wife, for four years. But all the time I spent boning up on his background didn't help when I met him at that "family" dinner. I simply was not prepared for the absolutely magnetic quality of Nick Spencer's personality. He was one of those people who are gifted with both inherent personal charm and a genuinely brilliant mind. A little over six feet tall, with dark blond hair, intensely blue eyes, and a trim athletic body, he was physically very attractive. It was his ability to interact with people, however, that came through as his greatest asset. As my mother attempted to keep the conversational ball going with Lynn, I found myself telling Nick more about myself than I had ever revealed to anyone at a first meeting. </p><p> Within five minutes he knew my age, where I lived, my job, and where I grew up. </p><p> "Thirty-two," he said, smiling. "Eight years younger than I am." </p><p> Then I not only told him that I had been divorced after a brief marriage to a fellow MBA student at NYU, but even talked about the baby who lived only a few days because the hole in his heart was too big to close. This was so not like me. I never talk about the baby. It hurts too much. And yet it was easy to tell Nicholas Spencer about him. </p><p> "That's the sort of tragedy our research will prevent someday," he had said gently. "That's why I'll move heaven and earth to save people from the kind of heartbreak you've experienced, Carley." </p><p> My thoughts were quickly brought back to the present reality as Charles Wallingford hammered the gavel until there was silence -- an angry, sullen silence. "I am Charles Wallingford, the chairman of the board of Gen-stone," he said. </p><p> He was greeted with a deafening chorus of boos and catcalls. </p><p> I knew Wallingford was forty-eight or forty-nine years old, and I had seen him on the news the day after Spencer's plane crashed. He looked much older than that now. The strain of the last few weeks had added years to his appearance. No one could doubt that the man was suffering. </p><p> "I worked with Nicholas Spencer for the past eight years," he said. "I had just sold our family retail business, of which I was chairman, and I was looking for a chance to invest in a promising company. I met Nick Spencer, and he convinced me that the company he had just started would make startling breakthroughs in the development of new drugs. At his urging I invested almost all the proceeds from the sale of our family business and joined Gen-stone. So I am as devastated as you are by the fact that the vaccine is not ready to be submitted to the FDA for approval, but that does not mean if more funds become available, further research will not solve the problem -- " </p><p> Dozens of shouted questions interrupted him: "What about the money he stole?" "Why not admit that you and that whole bunch up there cheated us?" </p><p> Abruptly Lynn stood up and in a surprise gesture pulled the microphone from in front of Wallingford. "My husband died on his way to a business meeting to get more funding to keep the research alive. I am sure that the missing money can be explained -- " </p><p> One man came running up the aisle waving pages that looked as though they had been torn from magazines and newspapers. "The Spencers on their estate in Bedford," he shouted. "The Spencers hosting a charity ball. Nicholas Spencer smiling as he writes a check for 'New York's Neediest.'" </p><p> Security guards grabbed the man's arms as he reached the dais. "Where did you think that money was coming from, lady? I'll tell you where. <i>It came from our pockets!</i> I put a second mortgage on my house to invest in your lousy company. You wanna know why? Because my kid has cancer, and I believed your husband's promise about his vaccine." </p><p> The media section was in the first few rows. I was in an end seat and could have reached out and touched the man. He was a burly-looking guy of about thirty, dressed in a sweater and jeans. I watched as his face suddenly crumpled and he began to cry. "I won't even be able to keep my little girl in our house," he said. "I'll have to sell it now." </p><p> I looked up at Lynn and our eyes met. I knew it was impossible for her to see the contempt in my eyes, but all I could think was that the diamond on her finger was probably worth enough to pay off the second mortgage that was going to cost a dying child her home. </p><p><br> The meeting didn't last more than forty minutes, and most of it consisted of a series of agonized recitals from people who had lost everything by investing in Gen-stone. Many of them said they had been persuaded to buy the stock because a child or other family member had a disease that the vaccine might reverse. </p><p> As people streamed out, I took names, addresses, and phone numbers. Thanks to my column, a lot of them knew my name and were eager to talk to me about their financial loss as well. They asked whether or not I thought there was any chance of recouping some or all of their investment. </p><p> Lynn had left the meeting by a side door. I was glad. I had written her a note after Nick's plane crashed, letting her know I would attend a memorial service. There hadn't been one yet; they were waiting to see if his body would be recovered. Now, like almost everyone else, I wondered if Nick had actually been in the plane when it crashed or if he had rigged his disappearance. </p><p> I felt a hand on my arm. It was Sam Michaelson, a veteran reporter for <i>Wall Street Weekly</i> magazine. "Buy you a drink, Carley," he offered. </p><p> "Good God, I can use one." </p><p> We went down to the bar on the lobby floor and were directed to a table. It was four-thirty. </p><p> "I have a firm rule not to have vodka straight up before five o'clock," Sam told me, "but, as you're aware, somewhere in the world it <i>is</i> five o'clock." </p><p> I ordered a glass of Chianti. Usually by late April I'd have switched to chardonnay, my warm weather choice of vino, but feeling as emotionally chilled as I did after that meeting, I wanted something that would warm me up. </p><p> Sam gave the order, then abruptly asked, "So what do you think, Carley? Is that crook sunning himself in Brazil as we speak?" </p><p> I gave the only honest answer I could offer: "I don't know." </p><p> "I met Spencer once," Sam said. "I swear if he'd offered to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge, I'd have fallen for it. What a snake oil salesman. Did you ever meet him in the flesh?" </p><p> I pondered Sam's question for a moment, trying to decide what to say. The fact that Lynn Hamilton Spencer was my stepsister, making Nick Spencer my stepbrother-in-law, was something I never talked about. However, that fact did keep me from ever commenting publicly or privately on Gen-stone as an investment because I felt that might be considered a conflict of interest. Unfortunately, it did not keep me from buying $25,000 worth of Gen-stone stock because, as Nicholas Spencer had put it that evening at dinner, after this vaccine eliminated the possibility of cancer, there would someday be another to eliminate all genetic abnormalities. </p><p> My baby had been baptized the day he was born. I'd called him Patrick, giving him my maternal grandfather's name. I bought that stock as kind of a tribute to my son's memory. That night two years ago Nick had said that the more money they could raise, the faster they would have the tests on the vaccine completed and be able to make it available. "And, of course, eventually your twenty-five thousand dollars will be worth a great deal more," he had added. </p><p> That money had represented my savings toward a down payment on an apartment. </p><p> I looked at Sam and smiled, still debating my answer. Sam's hair is a kind of grizzled gray. His one vanity is to comb long strands of it over his balding dome. I've noticed that these strands often are somewhat askew, as they were now, and as an old pal I've had to resist saying, "Surrender. You've lost the hair battle." </p><p> Sam is pushing seventy, but his baby blue eyes are bright and alert. There's nothing babyish behind that pucklike face, however. He's smart and shrewd. I realized it wouldn't be fair not to tell him of my somewhat tenuous connection to the Spencers, but I would make it clear that I'd actually met Nick only once and Lynn three times. </p><p> I watched his eyebrows raise as I filled him in on the relationship. </p><p> "She comes through as a pretty cool customer to me," he said. "What about Spencer?" </p><p> "I would have bought the Brooklyn Bridge from him, too. I thought he was a terrific guy." </p><p> "What do you think now?" </p><p> "You mean, whether he's dead or somehow arranged the crash? I don't know." </p><p> "What about the wife, your stepsister?" </p><p> I know I winced. "Sam, my mother is genuinely happy with Lynn's father, or else she's putting on one hell of a performance. God help us, the two of them are even taking piano lessons together. You should have heard the concert I got treated to when I went down to Boca for a weekend last month. I admit I didn't like Lynn when I met her. I think she kisses the mirror every morning. But then, I only saw her the night before the wedding, at the wedding, and one other time when I arrived in Boca last year just as she was leaving. So do me a favor and don't refer to her as my stepsister." </p><p> "Noted." </p><p> The waitress came with our drinks. Sam sipped appreciatively and then cleared his throat. "Carley, I just heard that you applied for the job that's opening up at the magazine." </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "How come?" </p><p> "I want to write for a serious financial magazine, not just have a column that is essentially a financial filler in a general interest Sunday supplement. Reporting for <i>Wall Street Weekly</i> is my goal. How do you know I applied?" </p><p> "The big boss, Will Kirby, asked about you." </p><p> "What did you tell him?" </p><p> "I said you had brains and you'd be a big step up from the guy who's leaving." </p><p> Half an hour l...</p></p><h2>Once Upon a Piece of Paper: A Visual Guide to Collage Making</h2><p><p>*Includes a 112-page paperback book plus a pad of 100 unique collage papers on two-sided sheets, all inside of a beautiful hardcover case with an elastic band.<br><br><b>Find out how layers of simple paper can create mysterious and beautiful worlds within worlds through the art of collage.</b><br><br><i>Once Upon a Piece of Paper: A Visual Guide to Collage</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a dynamic mix of art-making wisdom, creative inspiration, and fun activities to guide curious artists on the art of collage.&nbsp;Readers are treated to a simple yet sophisticated "look and learn" approach,&nbsp;all in a very special package.<br><br> Yet, how does one begin collaging?

But the truth is different: literature and art are pathways of feeling, and our encounter with them is social, inscribing us in a larger community.... Through art we discover that we are not alone.&#x201d;<br><br>So writes the esteemed Brown University professor Arnold Weinstein in this brilliant, radical exploration of Western literature. In the tradition of Harold Bloom and Jacques Barzun, Weinstein guides us through great works of art, to reveal how literature constitutes nothing less than a feast for the heart. Our encounter with literature and art can be a unique form of human connection, an entry into the storehouse of feeling.<br><br>Writing about works by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dickens, Charlotte Bront�, Munch, Proust, O&#x2019;Neill, Burroughs, DeLillo, Tony Kushner, Toni Morrison, and others, Weinstein explores how writers and artists give us a vision of what human life is really all about. Reading is an affair of the heart as well as of the mind, deepening our sense of the fundamental forces and emotions that govern our lives, including fear, pain, illness, loss, depression, death, and love.<br><br>Provocative, beautifully written, essential, A Scream Goes Through the House traces the human cry that echoes in literature through the ages, demonstrating how intense feelings are heard and shared. With intellectual insight and emotional acumen, Weinstein reveals how the scream that resounds through the house of literature, history, the body, and the family shows us who we really are and joins us together in a vast and timeless community.</p><p>&#x201c;Simply put, <b>A Scream Goes Through the House</b> is a breakthrough book, a triumph of scholarship and writing. What a treat it is to have Weinstein guide us through some of the canonical works of literature and show us what we have intuitively suspected: that literature does more than just entertain; literature educates, literature provides us with a map for our journey, and literature gives the journey meaning. Indeed, A Scream Goes Through the House proves its own thesis by doing just that for the reader. It is a book for the ages.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Abraham</b> <b>Verghese</b>, author of <b>The Tennis Partner</b> and <b>My Own Country</b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>A Scream Goes Through the House</b> is the crown of Arnold Weinstein&#x2019;s distinguished career as a teacher and writer, a deep response to great works of prose and poetry, art, theater, and film from Sophocles and Shakespeare to a wealth of modern authors. This book is literally a matter of life and death, for it celebrates the bonds between our mortality and our survival, our pain and our sensitivity, our frailty and our strength, our individual and communal selves, the vital bridges only works of imagination can construct. A scream goes through the house, and whether it is the house of art or the house of human-kind, that scream&#x2014;thanks to Weinstein&#x2019;s insight, eloquence, and courage&#x2014;pierces the heart, wounding us even as it makes us whole and well. A passionate tribute to the power of art to restore us all.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Robert</b> <b>Fagles</b>Arnold Weinstein is the Edna and Richard Salomon Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at Brown University.

Pastry chef and food stylist Victoria Granof has traveled throughout Sicily learning sweet secrets and local lore from the island's pastry chefs and home bakers, and the result is <em>Sweet Sicily,</em> a lushly photographed exploration of authentic Sicilian pastry-making.</p><p>For more than two thousand years, Sicily has been coveted for its fertile land and unique location in the Mediterranean. The Greeks, Romans, Normans, Austrians, French, Bourbons, and Saracens have all landed on its shores, and in turn left their imprints on its food. Granof's magical tour takes us to Modica, where Franco and Pierpaolo Ruta of the Antica Dolceria Bonajuto create chocolate pastries using a five-hundred-year-old recipe that originated with the island's Bourbon conquerors, and to the Baroque town of Noto, where master pastry chef Corrado uses jasmine blossoms planted by Saracens more than a thousand years ago to flavor his jasmine <em>gelato.</em> Granof goes on a quest to find the most authentic ingredients and recipes, including delectable homemade ricotta made from the milk of sheep that graze on fragrant herbs and pistachios that grow in the shadow of Mount Etna, the island's still active volcano.</p><p>In Sicily, every holiday and festival has its proper sweet accompaniment: marzipan lambs at Easter, honeyed pastry fritters at Christmas, crunchy, clove-scented cookies called "bones of the dead" for All Soul's Day. Granof explores these customs and festivals, gathering heirloom recipes, along with local anecdotes and advice. In addition to sweets that are already familiar to Americans, such as <em>cannoli, cassata,</em> and lemon ice, she introduces us to dozens of delectable pastries, confections, and cookies that are destined to become favorites as well.</p><p>With a guide to festivals and pastry shops throughout the island, and nearly one hundred recipes formulated for use in American kitchens, <em>Sweet Sicily</em> is an unforgettable exploration of the desserts of the world's most beguiling island.</p></p><p>In Sicily they eat ice cream for breakfast. That fact alone was enough to convince Victoria Granof that she had to go there. <i>Sweet Sicily: The Story of an Island and Her Pastries</i> is the result of a number of Granof's visits to Sicily, during which she confesses she ate more sweets than she ever thought possible. With plenty of humor and great respect, Granof shares what she learned from her experiences in Sicily and the friends she made there. Few of these sweets are fancy, and all are very traditional. Light and crispy Sweet Ricotta Turnovers from the Bar di Noto in Piana degli Albanesi and Chewy Pistachio Cookies shared by Giuseppe Chemi of Pasticceria Etna in Taormina are Sicily personified. All 106 of the recipes, such as the elegant little Engagement Cookies filled with almonds and cinnamon and honey-drenched Rice Fritters, call for the same ingredients the Sicilians have used for centuries. Learn to make homemade ricotta cheese and you won't believe how good your cannoli can be. <i>--Leora Y. Bloom</i>Victoria Granof is a food stylist who was classically trained at Le Cordon Bleu.

Tamwyn and his loyal troupe must split up: Elli to rush to the Lady of the Lake, Scree to heal with the Eaglefolks, and Tamwyn to journey to the Heartwood of Avalon itself to discover the portal to the highest branches and confront the very powers of Darkness.</p><p>T.A.

Its floor, walls, and furniture all sparkled with a moist, silvery sheen, like frozen mist. The ceiling, unlike any they&#x2019;d ever seen, tapered to a point high above their heads. All at once, the truth struck home, and they turned to each other. </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re inside the tree!&#x201d; they both said at once. </p><p>&#x201c;I do have chairs, you know,&#x201d; rang a mischievous voice behind them. </p><p>They spun around&#x2014;and then leaped to their feet. Tamwyn accidentally stepped on Elli&#x2019;s toes, but she hardly noticed. For seated before them was the Lady of the Lake herself. </p><p>She sat in a chair sprouting out of the floor, a crystalline burl that was part of the tree itself. Under its vaporous surface, it seemed as solid as any wooden chair&#x2014;maybe more so, since it looked as if it had lasted all the ages of Avalon. The woman herself seemed quite old, and yet her gray-blue eyes twinkled with youthful vitality. She studied her guests, playing with the curls of her silver hair, until at last she spoke to them in a rich, gentle voice. </p><p>&#x201c;And so we meet,&#x201d; she declared, inclining her head to each of them in turn. &#x201c;Elliryanna Lailoken. A mouthful of a name, that is! No wonder you go by just Elli.&#x201d; She grinned playfully at the surprised young woman, then turned to Tamwyn. &#x201c;And Tamwyn, who doesn&#x2019;t even know his full name.&#x201d; She watched him shift uncomfortably, then added softly: &#x201c;Although ... I do.&#x201d; </p><p>Tamwyn started. He leaned forward and opened his mouth to ask her to say more, when she raised her hand. &#x201c;Later, Tamwyn.&#x201d; Reluctantly, he shut his mouth, though his dark eyes stared at her in wonder. </p><p>She turned at last to Nuic, who was standing on the sparkling floor beside Elli. This time, she did more than incline her head. She drew her thick shawl about her shoulders and rose from her chair, as gracefully as a spiral of mist. Then she made a full curtsey to the pinnacle sprite. </p><p>&#x201c;Nuic,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How good to see you.&#x201d; </p><p>The Lady&#x2019;s special treatment of Nuic was, for Elli, surprising enough. But what words then came out of his mouth surprised her even more. For her ever-grumpy maryth said nothing harsh or even irreverent. He simply said graciously, &#x201c;The pleasure is mine.&#x201d; </p><p>Elli glanced down at the sprite, whose colors were vibrant blues and greens. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve met before?&#x201d; </p><p>Nuic just shrugged. &#x201c;You could say that, Elliryanna.&#x201d; </p><p>The Lady, watching him, fingered the amulet of oak, ash, and hawthorn leaves that hung around her neck. &#x201c;Indeed you could.&#x201d; </p><p>Tamwyn and Elli traded glances. Then, while Elli puzzled over the sprite&#x2019;s strange behavior, Tamwyn turned back to the Lady. Her eyes, so bright, with both gray and blue, reminded him of the mist swirling on the sapphire lake. And there was something else about her&#x2014;something magical&#x2014;that made him think of the museo he&#x2019;d seen that night back in Stoneroot. Although he&#x2019;d been mired in a heap of dung, that museo, and the strange bard with the sideways-growing beard, had lifted his spirits right out of the dung and into the stars. </p><p>That&#x2019;s how Tamwyn felt just now, for no reason he could name: ready to reach as high as he could. As high as the true heir of Merlin, perhaps&#x2014;even if, as he feared, he was really very different. As different from Merlin&#x2019;s heir as anyone could possibly be. </p><p>The Lady of the Lake sat again, and gestured for them to do the same. Both Elli and Tamwyn found shimmering burls beside the enchantress, not far from a wide hearth that glowed steadily. But it wasn&#x2019;t any fire that produced the glow. It was, as Elli realized with astonishment, a cluster of light flyers&#x2014;tiny winged creatures who were among the rarest in Avalon. They were crawling across the back of the hearth, their frilled wings pulsing with golden light. </p><p>&#x201c;What a beautiful way to light your home,&#x201d; said Elli. </p><p>&#x201c;And no need for kindling,&#x201d; said the wilderness guide next to her. </p><p>&#x201c;Hmmmpff,&#x201d; said Nuic in his usual crusty style. He had chosen to sit on the floor, not far from the Lady&#x2019;s bare feet. &#x201c;At least they&#x2019;re friendlier than the last winged beasts we encountered.&#x201d; </p><p>The Lady&#x2019;s eyes grew suddenly sad. &#x201c;Ah, yes. You have met ghoulacas.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Where did they come from?&#x201d; asked Tamwyn. </p><p>The old enchantress sighed. &#x201c;They are fairly new to Avalon, made by some hand I do not recognize. Yet this much I can tell you: In their blood runs an ancient evil. As old as Merlin&#x2019;s magical seed. The same evil that fanned the flames of greed and hatred into the War of Storms.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; protested Tamwyn, &#x201c;that war, and that whole age, ended long ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It did indeed.&#x201d; The elder woman drew herself up straighter. &#x201c;We ended it, Merlin and I, with the Treaty of the Swaying Sea. But the evil did not die. It merely retreated to the shadows.&#x201d; </p><p>She plucked at one of the green threads in her gown, holding it closer to the hearth&#x2019;s light. At once, Tamwyn and Elli realized that it wasn&#x2019;t a thread at all, but a living vine. Her entire gown was woven of vines and leafy green shoots, all supple and alive. To Elli, it was almost&#x2014;though not quite&#x2014;as beautiful as the gown of woven spider&#x2019;s silk worn by the High Priestess. </p><p>&#x201c;You see this vine?&#x201d; asked the Lady. &#x201c;Green it is, and green it will remain, so long as my will is there to support it. The same is true for a friendship, a marriage ... or a treaty of peace.&#x201d; </p><p>Tamwyn gazed into the hearth. &#x201c;So when the people lose their will for peace, things will happen&#x2014;things like ghoulacas?&#x201d; </p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;And more.&#x201d; </p><p>He chewed his lip. &#x201c;Things like weird, moaning winds ... and strange white lakes.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Or maybe even,&#x201d; added Elli, &#x201c;distant stars going dark.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Or things more subtle, that can&#x2019;t be seen,&#x201d; declared Nuic. &#x201c;Things like arrogance. In a priestess, or a so-called teacher.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s eyes, glowing brighter than the hearth, peered at Nuic. &#x201c;The same sort of arrogance that, long ago, caused Rhiannon, daughter of Elen the Founder, to resign as High Priestess and leave the Society that she&#x2019;d worked so long and hard to create.&#x201d; </p><p>Elli started. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s why Rhia walked out?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hmmmpff,&#x201d; corrected Nuic. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t just walk out. She stormed out&#x2014; shouting and hurling insults right and left. I remember well, I saw it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nuic,&#x201d; demanded Elli. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;d ever been to the Drumadians&#x2019; compound before last month.&#x201d; </p><p>The sprite eyed her grumpily. &#x201c;You think all I&#x2019;ve done with my life is sit on my ass in mountain streams? Well, think again.&#x201d; </p><p>Beneath the wrinkles on the Lady&#x2019;s cheeks, she grinned. And Tamwyn noticed, really for the first time, just how beautiful she looked. Not just radiant, and magical, and mysterious. Beautiful. </p><p>You must have been totally gorgeous when you were young, he thought to himself, speaking in his mind&#x2019;s private language that only non-human creatures understood. </p><p>To his absolute horror, she turned to him and answered with thoughts of her own. </p><p>So I&#x2019;m not gorgeous now? </p><p>Tamwyn sputtered and had such a sudden fit of coughing that he almost fell off his burl chair. As soon as he could speak again, he stammered, &#x201c;You&#x2014;you are, my gorgeous. I mean, my grace! Er, your gorge ... No, no. Your grace. You&#x2019;re really&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Amused,&#x201d; she cut in, her whole face alight. She reached over and patted his shoulder. &#x201c;I really am. And I&#x2019;m also flattered by your comments.&#x201d; </p><p>Elli drew her brows together. &#x201c;Comments? All I heard was coughing.&#x201d; </p><p>The Lady turned toward her. &#x201c;With Tamwyn, my dear, you have to listen closely. Just as a good guide might tell you to listen to the voices of the forest.&#x201d; </p><p>Both Elli and Tamwyn stiffened. &#x201c;So ...&#x201d; asked Elli, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve been watching us?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Only while you&#x2019;ve been in the forest. But that&#x2019;s long enough to know something else is troubling you. Something besides ghoulacas and vanishing stars.&#x201d; </p><p>She faced Tamwyn. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; </p><p>He hesitated. &#x201c;Well ... who really is the true heir of Merlin? And is he ...&#x201d; His eyes darted over to Elli. &#x201c;Is he really like a brother to that, that other person?&#x201d; </p><p>Long and hard, the Lady looked at him, saying nothing. </p><p>Tamwyn swallowed. </p><p>&#x201c;Before we talk more,&#x201d; the Lady said at last, &#x201c;I should like to offer you a meal.&#x201d; </p><p>She rose, beckoning them to come across the room to a round hole in the floor where a spiral stairway descended. Elli picked up Nuic and followed, while Tamwyn came last. Down they went, stepping on the glistening stairs that seemed as delicate as wisps of mist. Soon they stood in another room, lit not by a glowing hearth but by rays of starlight that poured through knot holes in the trunk of the tree. In the center of the room sat a table and four chairs, all sprouted from the tree. As they sat down, the Lady brushed some silver curls off her brow and waved her hand in the air. </p><p>A flock of faeries suddenly appeared, flying in through the holes in the trunk. Their wings, colored the same misty blue as their flowing tunics, whirred through the shafts of starlight. It seemed as if their wings caused ripples and swirls in the light as they passed, like a hand moving through a quiet pool of water. </p><p>Some of the faeries carried slabs of honeycomb, dripping with sweet nectar; others brought apples, raspberries, blueberries, tangerines, and pears, all bulging with succulent juices. Still other faeries bore fresh green shoots, mushrooms, tubers, and tangy strips of salted chewbark. There were open shells piled high with sweetnuts and orange cream, honey-glazed walnuts, and rosehip rolls filled with sliced strawberries. And to top it all off&#x2014;platters overflowing with chocolates. Made from cocoa beans and sugar cane, the chocolates had been deftly formed into the shapes of maple leaves, pine cones, and raspberries. Finally, to drink, the faeries brought wooden cups that brimmed with the simplest and most delightful prize of all: fresh, clear water from a secret woodland stream. </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Tamwyn as he stared at the magnificent feast arrayed before them. The Lady shook her head. &#x201c;Do not thank me. Thank the forest. For all this comes as a gift, given freely by the land.&#x201d; She reached out her hands, clasping those of Elli and Tamwyn. &#x201c;But first, before we eat, let us take a moment to meditate. As Rhiannon herself once said: </p><p>Listen to Creation&#x2019;s morning,Waking all around you.Feel the spark of dawn within,Breaking day has found you.&#x201d; </p><p>Elli beamed. &#x201c;I just love those words.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you, now?&#x201d; The Lady gave her hand a slight squeeze. </p><p>&#x201c;Hmmmpff,&#x201d; was Nuic&#x2019;s only comment. </p><p>A moment of silence ensued, and Tamwyn tried to think about the beauties of theforest that had produced this meal&#x2014;the flowing rills, the boughs heavy with fruit, the starlit wings of the misty blue faeries. But hard as he tried, he couldn&#x2019;t think about such things without imagining the rills going dry, the fruit withering and losing all its color, the faeries leaving their homes in search of starlight. </p><p>That&#x2019;s not meditation, Tamwyn, came the Lady&#x2019;s gentle voice inside his head..That&#x2019;s all your worries. He looked at her. What he saw in those gray-blue eyes was a sadness beyond anything he could comprehend. And yet ... sparkling in the depths, he caught the faintest glimmer of something else. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure, but it seemed almost like a challenge. Or perhaps ... a hope. </p><p>At a nod from the Lady, they began to eat. And eat, and eat! At some point in the meal, between the sweetnuts with orange cream and the honey-glazed walnuts, the Lady announced, &#x201c;I would like to tell you a story. Keep eating, now, don&#x2019;t stop. Just listen to a true tale of Avalon, one that happened very long ago, before any of you&#x2014;save you, my dear Nuic&#x2014;were born.&#x201d; </p><p>She took a sip of crystal clear water. &#x201c;Long ago, in the Year of Avalon 130, a terrible blight appeared right here in the upper reaches of El Urien ... which in the wood elves&#x2019; language means Deepest Forest. Everything the blight touched withered and died, from the biggest tree to the smallest lichen. Some thought it was a disease spawned by the woodland marshes; others took comfort in the belief that it would never spread to other realms. But the High Priestess of the time&#x2014;Rhiannon&#x2014;felt differently. She felt sure that the blight was the work of the wicked spirit lord Rhita Gawr, who hoped to cause havoc in Avalon, to make this world his own. So Rhia sought help from the great wizard Merlin.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Who was also her brother, right?&#x201d; Tamwyn asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Hush, will you?&#x201d; Elli scolded. &#x201c;Of course he was her brother! Every little light flyer knows that.&#x201d; </p><p>The Lady raised her hand for silence, then went on. &#x201c;Merlin realized that there was only one way to stop the blight&#x2014;to obtain a pure crystal of �lano, which is the most powerful, and also the most elusive, magical substance in Avalon. Produced deep within the roots of the Great Tree, it is the Tree&#x2019;s essential sap, supporting all forms of life. Yes&#x2014;even you and me! Merlin called �lano &#x2018;the true life-giving force of Avalon&#x2019; ... but even he didn&#x2019;t comprehend all its powers. </p><p>What he did know was that, while �lano needs no guidance to work its healing magic, it can still be shaped by strong wizardry.&#x201d; </p><p>She drew a slow breath. &#x201c;There is only one place in Avalon where undiluted �lano is found, with enough quantity to make a pure crystal: the White Geyser of Crystillia, not far from this very forest. Bursting forth at the uppermost canyon of High Brynchilla, this geyser carries enough �lano that its water actually glows at night.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And the water from that geyser also carries colors,&#x201d; added Elli. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so white. My father used to tell me stories about it&#x2014;how it flows down a big canyon to a place called Prism Gorge, and how it splits into all the colors of the rainbow.&#x201d; </p><p>Although Tamwyn was tempted to tell her to hush, just as she&#x2019;d told him, he didn&#x2019;t. For one thing, he was still within fist-striking distance&#x2014;no small matter, since he&#x2019;d gotten enough black eyes from her already. And for another, he just liked the way she talked about her father. He wished, in that moment, that he had known his own father. Or at least known for sure who he was. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Elli.&#x201d; The Lady gestured for a pair of faeries to refill her wooden cup, and they whirred over with a brimming water gourd. When they finished pouring, she thanked them and took another sip. </p><p>&#x201c;So Merlin got the crystal from the White Geyser?&#x201d; asked Elli. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; answered the Lady. &#x201c;To make a pure crystal of �lano, he needed to find water that was perfectly still. The geyser wouldn&#x2019;t work, nor would the river that runs from it down the Canyon of Crystillia to Prism Gorge.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is there a lake of this �lano water somewhere?&#x201d; asked Tamwyn. </p><p>To Elli&#x2019;s surprise, the Lady gave him an approving nod. &#x201c;Good thinking. There was only one such lake.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not ...&#x201d; Tamwyn frowned. &#x201c;Not that white lake we saw near the geyser? It didn&#x2019;t look right somehow.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Not right at all,&#x201d; she declared, her brow furrowed. &#x201c;About that, we&#x2019;ll hear more later. But in Merlin&#x2019;s day, there was only one such lake, and it lies far down inside the roots, many leagues below the White Geyser. Using portals known only to himself, Merlin took a remarkable journey deep within the Tree to find ...</p></p><h2>Cops and Robbers</h2><p>This is a new Puffin edition of Allan Ahlberg&#39;s best-selling Cops and Robbers classic picture book, with a brand new cover!

Pursuing the idea that human affection could be understood, studied, even measured, Harlow (1905-1981) arrived at his conclusions by conducting research-sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrible-on the primates in his University of Wisconsin laboratory. Paradoxically, his darkest experiments may have the brightest legacy, for by studying &#34;neglect&#34; and its life-altering consequences, Harlow confirmed love&#39;s central role in shaping not only how we feel but also how we think. His work sparked a psychological revolution. The more children experience affection, he discovered, the more curious they become about the world: Love makes people smarter. The biography of both a man and an idea, The Measure of Love is a powerful and at times disturbing narrative that will forever alter our understanding of human relationships.</p><p>"Incredible as it may seem, half a century ago leading psychologists scoffed at the notion that affection was vital to an infant's flourishing. Deborah Blum brilliantly recalls this chilling era, and the scientist whose controversial experiments reaffirmed love's importance. <i>Love at Goon Park</i> is science history at its best." --John Horgan, author of <i>The End of Science</i> <p> "Harry Harlow, whose name has become synonymous with cruel monkey experiments, actually helped put an end to cruel child-rearing practices. How these practices could ever have been advocated is only part of the puzzle presented in this lively biography. Blum does not shy away from the ethical questions raised by Harlow's research, yet reminds us that he was a complex man who won his battle with the scientific establishment so resoundingly that the outcome is now taken for granted."--Frans De Waal, author of <i>The Ape and the Sushi Master</i> </p><p> "<i>Love at Goon Park</i> is the important story of the human need for love. Deborah Blum tells the engaging tale of Harry Harlow and his groundbreaking research with monkeys that proved our essential drive for social attachment. This book is not just good science writing, it's a great story."--Meredith F. Small, author of <i>Our Babies, Ourselves</i> and <i>Kids</i> </p><p> "For generations of psychology students, the image of a baby monkey being comforted by a cloth doll is one of their most indeliable memories of the subject. Yet even most psychologists know little about the brilliant, funny, and infuriating man behind the experiments. Nor do many people know about its context--the fall and the rise of the concept of love in social science. Deborah Blum combines these elements into a gripping biography, written with intelligence, warmth, and panache."--Steven Pinker, author of <i>The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, </i> and <i>The Blank Slate</i></p><b>Deborah Blum</b> is a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin and Vice President of the National Association of Science Writers.

But now it looks like he may--a serial killer with a particularly frightening agenda. <br>Two officers from the American troops stationed in Caserta, Italy, not far from Naples, have been found murdered. Lieutenant Norman Landry was found behind a supply tent with his neck snapped. Captain Max Galante, MD, was strangled on the same night, and his body left in a garden outside HQ. The MOs are completely different, and it seems like the officers had no connection to each other, but one frightening fact links the murders: each body was discovered with a single playing card: the Lieutenant, the ten of hearts; the Captain, the jack of hearts. The message seems to be clear--if the murderer isn't apprehended, the higher ranks will be next. <br>Billy is sent to Italy for the investigation, which grows increasingly sinister. But he has other things on his mind, too. His girlfriend, Diana, is on a very dangerous spy mission, and Billy doesn't know when--or if--he'll see her again. To make matters worse, Billy's just learned that his baby brother, Danny, is being sent over to Europe as an infantry replacement, an incredibly dangerous assignment. And all around him, he sees GIs suffering from combat fatigue preparing for another battle. As the invasion at Anzio begins, Billy needs to keep a cool head amidst fear and terror as the killer calculates his next moves.</p></p><p><p><strong>Author One-on-One: James R. Benn and Hank Phillippi Ryan</strong></p> <p><b>Hank Phillippi Ryan:</b> Quick! Elevator pitch. What's your new book about?</p> <p><b>James R. Benn:</b> The sacrifices that loyalty demands. For Billy, it&#x2019;s personal: his kid brother experiences war as an infantry replacement, and he has to deal with his natural protective instinct. For other characters, the sacrifices are life, limb, and spirit as GIs who have been in battle for months are thrown into the ill-conceived Anzio invasion, while a murderer stalks American officers. </p> <p>Two officers from troops stationed near Naples, Italy, have been found dead. The first was a lieutenant, found behind a supply tent with his neck snapped. The body of a captain, strangled on the same night, was left in an elegant garden. One frightening fact links the murders: each body was discovered with a single playing card. The ten of hearts with the lieutenant; the jack of hearts with the captain. </p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> Oh, tell me more! </p> <p><b>Benn:</b> The fear among officers at headquarters is that a crazed killer is working on a royal flush, with a general targeted as the ace of hearts. Billy is sent to stop the murders before they go any further and interfere with the upcoming invasion south of Rome. But he has more to worry about; his kid brother Danny has been drafted to the platoon Billy is investigating. While Billy knows his brother wants to prove himself, he's also well aware that the lifespan of a front-line infantry replacement is measured in days or even hours of combat. With the added pressure of a murderer lurking nearby, Billy has to find a way to protect Danny's life, a daunting prospect on the battleground of the Anzio Beachhead.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> So what about Billy Boyle? Where did you first "meet" him? How did you come to know him? What about him endears him to you?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> I had a hint of Billy in 1972 when I watched <i>The Godfather</i>. In the opening wedding scene, which takes place in 1945, Michael is in his Marine uniform, a highly decorated veteran, and he&#x2019;s practically ignored. The Corleone family didn&#x2019;t value service to country, only family, and I wondered, what would it have been like if Sonny was the one who had to go into the service? I promptly did nothing with that idea for thirty years. When I was ready, it was the Boston Irish, not Sicilians, who gave birth to Billy. He arrived one day, fully formed and named, with a complete backstory. Instead of the Mafia, his family is organized around the Irish Republican Army and Boston Police Department, where promotions are handed out based on connections and family loyalties. Just as he was made Detective, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and Billy had to go to war. As far as the Boyles viewed things, no one had attacked Boston or Ireland; they saw no value in another war to help rescue the hated British Empire. They cook up a plan to have him serve out the war safely in Washington DC on the staff of a distant relative, an unknown general named Eisenhower. Things don't work out the way they planned.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> Love it. And it&#x2019;s always so revealing to hear where the first nugget of an idea comes from. And why your brain plucks it out of the universe, and understands instantly that it&#x2019;s the beginning of everything. I get goose bumps, sometimes, thinking of it. This book turned out to be about combat fatigue, right? Why did you choose that element?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> Because of a friend who's a state trooper. He was involved in two shootings, and was forced to kill his assailant each time. I saw how bravely he dealt with Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and that got me interested in what things were like for servicemen during World War II. It seems that in every war--starting with the Civil War, when it was called Soldier's Heart--we learn about the effects of violence on soldiers and then promptly forget about it before the next war. As late as 1944, army divisions in Italy did not have a single psychiatrist on their medical staffs. Today, we see the same struggles with PTSD in Iraq and Afghanistan, and lately with the proper diagnosis of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury from roadside bomb concussions.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> This is book six in your Billy Boyle series. Is it necessary to read them in order? Why? How has Billy changed over the books?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> No, it isn't necessary. There is a narrative arc concerning Billy and his English lover Diana Seaton, but that doesn't interfere with reading them out of order. Each book stands alone in terms of the story.</p> I think Billy has changed, in that the war has hardened him. He's suffered, and I think he's lost some of the innocence he had in the first book. But that's natural and quite necessary. This isn't <i>Hogan's Heroes</i>.<p></p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> What do you want your readers to understand or realize when they finish the last chapter?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> The price is high. And thank God we have men and women who are willing to pay it. That evil is all around us and hides within the places where fear causes us to look away. And that Billy has paid a price for his decision--but wait, I don't want to give that part away!</p><p><b>James R.

He is a haunting figure, a loner, on a spellbinding journey into good and evil, in a desolate world which frighteningly echoes our own. In his first step towards the powerful and mysterious Dark Tower, Roland encounters an alluring woman named Alice, begins a friendship with Jake, a kid from New York, and faces an agonising choice between damnation and salvation as he pursues the Man in Black. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, THE GUNSLINGER leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter. And the Tower is closer...</p><p>Thirty-three years, a horrific and life-altering accident, and thousands of desperately rabid fans in the making, Stephen King's quest to complete his magnum opus rivals the quest of Roland and his band of gunslingers who inhabit the Dark Tower series. Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than thirty books of which the most recent are DREAMCATCHER, EVERYTHING&#39;S EVENTUAL and FROM A BUICK 8.

Almost a decade earlier, Dr. Sacks had published his masterpiece <i>Awakenings&#x2015;</i>the account of his long-dormant patients&#x2019; miraculous but troubling return to life in a Bronx hospital ward. But the book had hardly been an immediate success, and the rumpled clinician was still largely unknown. Over the ensuing four years, the two men worked closely together until, for wracking personal reasons, Sacks asked Weschler to abandon the profile, a request to which Weschler acceded. The two remained close friends, however, across the next thirty years and then, just as Sacks was dying, he urged Weschler to take up the project once again. This book is the result of that entreaty.</p><p>Weschler sets Sacks&#x2019;s brilliant table talk and extravagant personality in vivid relief, casting himself as a beanpole Sancho to Sacks&#x2019;s capacious Quixote. We see Sacks rowing and ranting and caring deeply; composing the essays that would form <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>; recalling his turbulent drug-fueled younger days; helping his patients and exhausting his friends; and waging intellectual war against a medical and scientific establishment that failed to address his greatest concern: the spontaneous specificity of the individual human soul. And all the while he is pouring out a stream of glorious, ribald, hilarious, and often profound conversation that establishes him as one of the great talkers of the age. Here is the definitive portrait of Sacks as our preeminent romantic scientist, a self-described &#x201c;clinical ontologist&#x201d; whose entire practice revolved around the single fundamental question he effectively asked each of his patients: How <i>are</i> you? Which is to say, How <i>do</i> you <i>be</i>? </p><p>A question which Weschler, with this book, turns back on the good doctor himself.</p></p><p><b>Lawrence Weschler</b>, a longtime veteran of <i>The New Yorker</i> and a regular contributor to NPR, is the director emeritus of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU and the author of nearly twenty books, including<i> Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s Cabinet of Wonder,</i> <i>Everything That Rises, </i>and <i>Vermeer in Bosnia</i>.<p>"Provide[s] striking glimpses into a remarkable life.

He was an international treasure in many other ways: an article he wrote in 1945 led to the invention of satellite technology. Books by Mr. Clarke - both fiction and nonfiction - have more than one hundred million copies in print worldwide. He died in 2008 at the age of 90.Published in 1953, 1952, and 1979, respectively, this trio of novels follow Clarke's recurring theme of humans thrusting themselves into space and then not necessarily liking what they find.

Leading Australian journalist John Lyons will take readers on a fascinating personal journey through the wonders and dangers of the Middle East. From the sheer excitement of arriving in Jerusalem with his wife and eight-year-old son, to the fall of dictators and his gripping account of what it feels like to be taken by Egyptian soldiers, blindfolded and interrogated, this is a memoir of the Middle East like no other. Drawing on a 20-year interest in the Middle East, Lyons has had extraordinary access - he&#39;s interviewed everyone from Israel&#39;s former Prime Ministers Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert to key figures from Hezbollah and Hamas. He&#39;s witnessed the brutal Iranian Revolutionary Guard up close and was one of the last foreign journalists in Iran during the violent crackdown against the &#39;Green Revolution&#39;. He&#39;s confronted Hamas officials about why they fire rockets into Israel and Israeli soldiers about why they fire tear gas at Palestinian school children. By telling the story of his family travelling through the region, this book is extremely readable and entertaining, full of humour, colour. It is sometimes dazzling in its detail, sometimes tragic. Lyons says he has written it in a way that readers can feel they are there with him - so they can smell the wonderful markets of the Middle East and feel the fear of what it is like to be blindfolded and have your hands bound with electrical cord. Lyons also looks at 50 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank - the mechanics of how this works and the effect it now has on both Israelis and Palestinians.Lyons explains the Middle East through every day life and experiences - his son&#39;s school, his wife&#39;s friends and his own dealings with a range of people over six years. If you only read one book on the Middle East, this is it.</p><p>John Lyons is one of Australia's leading journalists. A three-time Walkley winner, John is currently Associate Editor (Digital Content) at <i>The Australian</i>. For six years he was <i>The Australian's</i> Middle East correspondent, based in Jerusalem with his wife, Sylvie Le Clezio, and son, Jack.

Rosenfelt&#39;s hilarious account of this cross-country move, &#34;Dogtripping,&#34; is being published by St. Martin&#39;s Press in July 2013.<br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>The three vehicles provided a surprisingly stable ride. The countryside in this desolate area of the world was rugged, famously so, but the cars were all-terrain models and could handle much worse. Besides, the ride would last half an hour maximum, and the passengers were not exactly unfamiliar with hardship and Spartan conditions. <br>Altogether there were eight men in the cars, three in the one in front, three in back, and two in the center car. Seven of the eight men were of little consequence in the grand scheme of things; they were there as protectors for one of the men in the middle car. <br>His name was Aarif Sajadi, and he was the target. <br>The aircraft flew twenty-one thousand feet above them, and they could neither hear nor see it. There were no passengers on board the flight; there never were. No flight attendants, no carry-on baggage compartments, no tray tables to be stowed, not even any seats to be restored to their original upright positions. <br>The pilot, Sergeant Brian Cole, could see the cars clearly, but even if the men stopped, took out incredibly powerful telescopes, and peered upward, they could not have seen him. That&#x2019;s because they were in the mountainous region of Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border, and he was sitting in a room at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, drinking coffee and nibbling on a blueberry muffin. <br>The aircraft that Cole was piloting was a MQ-1B Predator drone. Many people thought of drones almost as small model airplanes, carrying cameras and functioning as eyes in the skies. But this one was twenty-seven feet long, had a wingspan of fifty-five feet, and weighed almost fifteen hundred pounds, including its two Hellfire missiles. <br>Cole was literally flying it with the use of a console and joystick, as if he were playing a video game. He tried to fully concentrate, as his training dictated, but it wasn&#x2019;t easy. He&#x2019;d had a fight with his wife that morning before coming to work, and it was weighing on his mind. He thought maybe, when he was finished, that he should send her flowers. <br>Fortunately for Brian, though less so for the men in the cars, the Predator&#x2019;s MTS, or Multi-Spectral Targeting System, was doing most of the important work. Through the use of lasers, it had already homed in on the target and told the missiles where to go. All Cole would have to do was tell them when, by pressing a button. <br>At this point, the cars&#x2019; passengers were lucky to be blissfully unaware. Were they suddenly to know of the aircraft and its intentions, there was nothing they could have done about it. The nearest cover was too far for them to reach in the little time available to them. <br>They were dead men driving. <br>Cole did not think much about the political or legal implications of what he was about to do. He knew he was functioning as part of the American government&#x2019;s strategy of targeted killings, and he certainly assumed that the target in this case was considered a terrorist bent on inflicting harm to the United States. <br>And that was absolutely true. <br>Cole was forever seeing claims in the media that the number-three person in the terrorist network had been killed; probably fifteen &#x201c;number threes&#x201d; had bitten the dust in the past year. Cole had no idea how many of those killings he had been responsible for, if any, but there was one thing he knew for sure: If he ever became a terrorist and reached number four in the chain of command, he wouldn&#x2019;t want to get promoted. <br>A final systems check was accomplished, Cole pressed the button, and the three cars, as well as their occupants, ceased to exist. For Cole, having been at this for a while, it was business as usual. <br>But what he did not know was that Aarif Sajadi was not like any other target. If Sajadi did not die instantly, then in his last moments he likely took some comfort in the fact that he had already plotted his revenge against his killers, halfway around the world. <br>His death did nothing to change that. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I, Andy Carpenter, am not often stunned. I&#x2019;m a criminal defense attorney, and I&#x2019;ve handled some high-profile cases with many twists and turns, so I&#x2019;ve generally learned to go with the flow, to expect the unexpected. <br>I am therefore difficult to surprise, but at 7:34 P.M. on March 17, in my Paterson, New Jersey, office, I have just seen something that has left me shaken to the core. <br>Edna. <br>I used to think of Edna as my secretary, until she informed me she was my &#x201c;administrative assistant.&#x201d; Then, a couple of years ago, she self-elevated her status to &#x201c;office manager.&#x201d; She most often &#x201c;manages&#x201d; the office from a remote location, since she works maybe one day a week. <br>Actually, I&#x2019;ve overstated it. She comes in one day a week, but she gets almost no work done even then. Instead she endlessly does crossword puzzles and considers herself the best in the world at it. She also talks on the phone a great deal, mostly with her enormous extended family. <br>But to see her here in the evening, outside of business hours, is disorienting. Edna simply does not work overtime. She doesn&#x2019;t even work regular time. <br>In fact, it&#x2019;s more than disorienting; it&#x2019;s astonishing. It would be like walking into a bowling alley and seeing the queen of England throwing practice balls on lane fourteen. Yet here Edna is, hunched over her desk, writing on some papers, so engrossed that she barely looks up when I arrive. <br>With her is Sam Willis, my accountant, who has an office down the hall. He&#x2019;s sitting on a couch, but Edna&#x2019;s not paying any attention to him; she&#x2019;s too intent on what she&#x2019;s doing. Sam&#x2019;s the reason I&#x2019;m here. He said he wanted to talk with me about something important. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Sam&nbsp;&#x2026; Edna,&#x201d; I say, which is a witty opening conversational gambit I&#x2019;ve recently come up with. <br>&#x201c;Andy, thanks for coming in,&#x201d; Sam says, while Edna merely manages an &#x201c;mmm,&#x201d; without looking up. <br>I tell Sam to come into my office so we can talk. Once we get in there, I close the door and say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s seven thirty, and Edna&#x2019;s here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So did we turn the clocks back or something, and I didn&#x2019;t realize it?&#x201d; <br>He shakes his head. &#x201c;No, but even that would be just an hour. She&#x2019;d still be here late.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I meant, did we turn the clocks back to 1978?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s tournament time,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been practicing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aaahh.&#x201d; Suddenly it all makes sense. Edna has long been talking about entering a national crossword puzzle tournament, held once a year in Brooklyn. She&#x2019;s never actually entered, and I&#x2019;ve always assumed it was due to some secret self-doubt about her prowess. But now she seems to be ready to throw her pencil in the ring. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re going to get much work out of her these next few weeks,&#x201d; Sam says. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shocker. What did you want to talk to me about?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I think I may have a new client for you.&#x201d; <br>Sam says that with an expression and tone in his voice that indicate he thinks he is giving me good news. &#x201c;Yippee skippee,&#x201d; I say. <br>I have a lot of money, many millions, some earned and more inherited. What I don&#x2019;t have is a desire to work. I&#x2019;m not sure where I left it, but it&#x2019;s been missing for a while, and I haven&#x2019;t searched real hard. <br>Unfortunately, even though I don&#x2019;t seek clients, I seem to wind up with some, and long trials have often been the result. Working long trials is the only thing I dislike more than working short trials. <br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t interested in new clients?&#x201d; Sam asks. <br>&#x201c;What tipped you off?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay. Whatever you say.&#x201d; Sam seems rather chagrined at my reaction. He thought he was doing something good for a friend, and the friend just blew him off. I decide to soften the blow by acting half interested. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the case? Maybe I can recommend someone.&#x201d; <br>He shrugs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I went to high school with this guy, Barry Price. Last time I had seen him was a couple of years ago, at the reunion. I think I told you about him; he&#x2019;s the guy who married my high school sweetheart, Denise.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How come you didn&#x2019;t?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Believe it or not, I dumped her when I went off to college. Biggest mistake of my life.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry to hear that.&#x201d; Coming here is now showing signs of being one of the biggest mistakes of my life. This is already a long story, and Laurie Collins is waiting for me at home. That means that no matter what Sam was telling me, I&#x2019;d want him to hurry the hell up. <br>&#x201c;Anyway, he calls me the other day and invites me to a party at his house last night; you should see this place. I&#x2019;m not sure why he invited me, but as I&#x2019;m leaving, he asks if I can come back tonight, that he needs my help. He sounded a little worried about something, but he wouldn&#x2019;t tell me what. Then he asked if I still knew you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How did he know that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I guess I mentioned you at the reunion, sort of name-dropping, you know? You&#x2019;re famous. He said he might want to hire you, and could I put the two of you together.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;ve had a lot of high-profile cases over the years, many of which have been heavily covered in the media. But famous? Aww, shucks. <br>He continues. &#x201c;He told me to pack a bag, that we&#x2019;d be flying somewhere on his private plane. Barry&#x2019;s really rich, in case that changes your mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Sam. Not a chance.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really? I thought you might even come out there with me tonight.&#x201d; <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m retired.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Officially?&#x201d; <br>I look at my watch and nod. &#x201c;Effective seven forty-two P.M. But if you let me know what&#x2019;s going on, I&#x2019;ll recommend another lawyer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As good as you?&#x201d; he asks. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous.&#x201d; <br>Sam heads off to his friend&#x2019;s house, and I head home to Laurie. Edna remains at her desk, with no signs of leaving any time soon. <br>We have entered the bizarro world, where black is white, up is down, left is right, and Edna is in the office after five o&#x2019;clock. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Like so many of these things, it began in a bar. Drew Keller was in the right place at the right time. And while an undercover cop&#x2019;s job was, in fact, to be in that right place at that right time, Drew had to admit to himself that this was more than a little lucky. <br>He was investigating a series of auto parts thefts in the Concord, New Hampshire, area, and had developed a relationship with a possible suspect whom he believed held some promise. The man&#x2019;s name was Rodney Larsen, and he was straight out of central casting for someone in Drew&#x2019;s line of work. Rodney was a walking undercover trifecta&#x2014;stupid, talkative, and boastful. <br>Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s hard to reveal information that you don&#x2019;t have, and Drew was starting to believe that his instinct was wrong, that Rodney was a dry well when it came to the robberies. <br>And then he caught a possible break. <br>It took three nights and a whole bunch of beers, but Rodney said that his brother and another friend were going to &#x201c;kill a big shot&#x201d; and that he was a part of the team. He wouldn&#x2019;t say much more, but when Drew convinced him that he had access to high-tech weaponry and the willingness to use it, he was promised an invite to meet the others and possibly join the team. <br>So the plan was for them to come to the bar the next night to get to know Drew and see if he was suitable to sign up for whatever they had planned. He was there at midnight, and Rodney was waiting for him. <br>But the plan had changed. <br>Rodney&#x2019;s coconspirators had decided that they didn&#x2019;t think the meeting should be in public, so Rodney said that he and Drew were supposed to leave the bar and meet at their &#x201c;place.&#x201d; <br>Because the original meeting was going to be in the public bar, Drew had not arranged for backup and surveillance. He was not comfortable heading into this situation, where he might be vulnerable, so he told Rodney that he would follow him in his car. That way he&#x2019;d be able to call in for backup while he was on the way, and they could follow the GPS device that he would activate on his car. <br>But when they got to the parking lot, it all changed for the worse. Much worse. Rodney&#x2019;s brother Alex was waiting there, and he came up behind Drew and held a gun to his back. Then he took Drew&#x2019;s concealed weapon, forced him into Rodney&#x2019;s car, and they drove off together. <br>Drew was alone, and he was in trouble. <br>They drove to a service station about three miles away. The station was closed for the night, but the back room was open and occupied. Still at gunpoint, Drew was forced into that room, where two other men were waiting for them. <br>One of the men was Earl Raulston, the third member of the group. The other was a man the three conspirators knew only as Carter. They assumed it was a last name, but no one was really sure. What was obvious, however, even to Drew, was that Carter did not fit in with this crew and that he was in charge. <br>&#x201c;Where is his gun?&#x201d; were the first words out of Carter&#x2019;s mouth. Alex, obviously proud that he had been the one to confiscate it, rushed over to Carter to hand it to him. Carter looked in the chamber to confirm that it was loaded and then put it on the table. <br>&#x201c;You are an undercover officer attempting to thwart our operation,&#x201d; Carter said. <br>&#x201c;Hey, man, this is bullshit,&#x201d; was Drew&#x2019;s response. &#x201c;Rodney here said there was some action to get in on, that&#x2019;s all. If you don&#x2019;t want me, that&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d; <br>Carter had no intention of arguing the point. Instead he took out his own gun and, without hesitating, shot Drew in the head, killing him instantly. <br>The others in the room were stunned, but no one was about to offer any criticism. &#x201c;I knew he was dirty,&#x201d; Rodney said. <br>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t change anything, does it?&#x201d; Alex asked. <br>&#x201c;Actually, it changes everything,&#x201d; Carter said. He picked up Drew&#x2019;s gun from the desk, and in a devastatingly quick motion, shot the other three men with it. <br>He had the ability to have cleanly killed each with one bullet in the center of the forehead, but that&#x2019;s not how it would have gone down in a chaotic firefight. So now he fired more erratically, and in the case of Alex and Earl, used two shots to make the kill. <br>The three murders took fewer than five seconds, leaving Carter the only living person in the room. And he would be there for a while; this was a scene that would have to be choreographed. <br>What law enforcement would find would be implausible but not impossible. Which would be plenty good enough. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Sam Willis kept his glove compartment full. In addition to the registration, insurance card, and other documents that are found in most cars, he kept a substantial number of wrapped Weight Watchers Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. He found them surprisingly good, and even though they obviously weren&#x2019;t fattening, he was able to overcome that deficiency by inhaling up to ten at a time. <br>But when Sam was driving, the glove compartment was also an electronics warehouse.

Since he doesn't want to hurt any feelings, he accepts all of them. While he has a wonderful time at each friend's house, he ends up eating a little too much. In the end, Turkey decides that next year he'll host all his friends at one party. This is a sweet story about friendship and the fun of Thanksgiving gatherings. Despite the main character being a turkey, the story is refreshingly free of jokes about the turkey being eaten. Instead, at each dinner, the turkey shares a meal that is appropriate for each farm animal (the pigs have a Thanksgiving stew, while mouse serves seeds and berries). In the end, "Turkey felt like part of the family. It was a wonderful feeling."

Information about his life in the text.</p><p>Felix Dennis was imprisoned in 1971 as co-editor of OZ magazine. After his acquittal on appeal, he founded his own magazine publishing company in 1973 and made millions with the sale of Personal Computer World and MacUser in the mid-eighties. Today, Dennis Publishing remains a privately owned company with headquarters in London and New York City. Titles include The Week, Auto Express, Computer Shopper and Maxim. The annual Sunday Times Rich List estimates that Felix Dennis is the 65th richest individual in the UK. Following a life-threatening illness, his first collection of poetry, A Glass Half Full was published by Hutchinson and the second, Lone Wolf, in 2004. His third collection, When Jack Sued Jill, was published by Ebury Press in November 2006. His other interests include planting trees and he divides his time between homes in Warwickshire, London, New York, Connecticut and the Caribbean island of Mustique.Though the subtitle of this photo-rich biography might suggest that it covers only a few years of Muhammad Ali's meteoric career, in fact authors Dennis and Atyeo deal with all of the heavyweight boxing champion's years in the ring: from his first bout at the age of 12 to his retirement at 38. Ali dominated the world of professional boxing for almost 20 years, but he was as famous for his political declarations and media-attracting antics as he was for his stunning innovations in technique. Dennis and Atyeo give a well-rounded portrait of the Kentucky fighter's many talents, drawing upon their own interviews with Ali as well as from interviews with his friends, family, opponents and trainers to create a swift, enjoyable read. They cover all of Ali's major fights-including those against Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Joe Frazier-as well as many less notable ones. Dennis and Atyeo are also careful not to pigeon-hole Ali into any one type, seeking, instead, to convey his many contradictions and transformations. The only aspect of his life that they appear to shy away from is the domestic, particularly his difficult and chauvinistic relationships with women. Though there are already many other competent biographies of Ali, this volume distinguishes itself from the mass with its easy, magazine-style prose (Dennis is the owner of Dennis Publishing, which is responsible for Blender and Maxim, among other magazines, and Atyeo is an Australian journalist), its clean design and its abundance of spectacular photographs. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part, Chapters 1 to 5, presents the fundamentals of the theory of electromagnetic retardation with emphasis on recently developed electromagnetic relations and mathematical techniques. Employing as the starting point the retarded electromagnetic field integrals rather than the traditional Lienard-Wiechert potentials and using the newest mathematical methods for operations with retarded integrals, the theory is presented in a clear and logical manner, and the applications of the theory are demonstrated by numerous well-chosen original illustrative examples. <p>As Professor Jefimenko shows, the theory of electromagnetic retardation leads to, and duplicates, many electromagnetic relations that are customarily considered to constitute consequences of relativistic electrodynamics. Much of the first part of the book is devoted to establishing a bridge between the theory of electromagnetic retardation and the theory of relativity. In the second part of the book, Chapters 6 to 11, all the fundamental equations of the special relativity theory, including equations of relativistic electrodynamics and mechanics, are derived in a natural and direct way from equations of electromagnetic retardation and from electromagnetic force and energy equations without any postulates, conjectures, or hypotheses. As a result, the theory of special relativity acquires a new physical and mathematical base and becomes united with Maxwellian electromagnetism into one simple, clear, and harmonious theory of electromagnetic phenomena and mechanical interactions between rapidly moving bodies. Numerous well-chosen original illustrative examples demonstrate various applications of the relativistic electrodynamics and relativistic mechanics developed in this part of the book. </p><p>The new approach to the formulations of the theory of relativity presented in this book makes it necessary to reexamine the conventional interpretation of some of the key aspects of the special relativity theory. One of the most significant results of this reexamination is that, although the idea of Lorentz length contraction played an important part in Einstein's approach to the formulation of the theory of relativity, this idea is not an integral part of the theory of relativity itself. Another equally significant result of this reexamination, based on an analysis of a dozen elementary electromagnetic clocks, is that the rate of the moving clocks depends both on the velocity and on the construction of the clocks, so that although all the clocks examined in the book run slow when in motion, only some clocks conform to Einstein's time-dilation formula; others do not. </p><p>Finally, the novel approach to the formulation of the special relativity theory developed in this book leads to the conclusion that gravitational phenomena are subject to essentially the same relativistic relations as are the electromagnetic phenomena. Based on this conclusion, a covariant formulation of Newton-Heaviside's gravitational theory is developed and presented in the last chapter of the book. </p><p>An Appendix to the book contains an analysis of the physical nature of electric and magnetic forces and presents a novel interpretation of the "near-action" mechanism of electromagnetic interactions.</p></p><p>This book is a sequel to my books "ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM" and "CAUSALITY, ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION, AND GRAVITATION". It is a result of a further exploration of the classical theory of fields in search of heretofore overlooked relations between physical quantities and heretofore overlooked applications of the theory. <p>As is known, electromagnetic fields propagate with finite velocity. Therefore there always is a time delay before a change in electromagnetic conditions initiated at a point of space produces an effect at any other point of space. This time delay is called electromagnetic retardation. The purpose of this book is to formulate a detailed theory of the phenomenon of electromagnetic retardation and to explore the basic consequences of the theory. </p><p>A very significant result of the theory of electromagnetic retardation developed in this book is the derivation of all essential equations of the special relativity theory directly from the fundamental equations of the theory of electromagnetic retardation (retarded electromagnetic field integrals) without any postulates or hypotheses. As a result of this derivation, Maxwellian electrodynamics and the theory of special relativity become united into one simple, clear and harmonious theory of electromagnetic phenomena and of mechanical interactions between rapidly moving bodies. </p><p>Although the book presents the results of original research, it is written as a textbook and contains numerous original illustrative examples and derivations demonstrating various applications of the theory developed in the book.</p>The author is a Professor of Physics at West Virginia University, USA</p><h2>Pinhole Cameras: A DIY Guide</h2><p>Did you ever think that the oatmeal container you open every morning when you make breakfast could be turned into a camera?

In this latest novel, our heroine Meredith Whitman is a career-driven investment banker, our husband Steve a sweet physician, and our other man, Cal Dow, a high-tech business Midas. When Cal offers Meredith the perfect job in San Francisco, Steve encourages her to move across country, and promises to follow her as soon as he can. Meredith and Steve's marriage begins to crack under the pressures of the distance, and soon "irresistible forces" come into play.

Hailed by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> as "a Sherlock Holmes for retailers," author and research company CEO Paco Underhill answers with a definitive "yes" in this witty, eye-opening report on our ever-evolving consumer culture. <i>Why We Buy</i> is based on hard data gleaned from thousands of hours of field research -- in shopping malls, department stores, and supermarkets across America. With his team of sleuths tracking our every move, from sweater displays at the mall to the beverage cooler at the drugstore, Paco Underhill lays bare the struggle among merchants, marketers, and increasingly knowledgeable consumers for control.<p>In his quest to discover what makes the contemporary consumer tick, Underhill explains the shopping phenomena that often go unnoticed by retailers and shoppers alike, including:</p><p></p><ul> <li>How a well-placed shopping basket can turn a small purchase into a significant sale<p> </p></li><li>What the "butt-brush factor" is and how it can make sales plummet<p> </p></li><li>How working women have altered the way supermarkets are designed<p> </p></li><li>How the "boomerang effect" makes product placement ever more challenging<p> </p></li><li>What kinds of signage and packaging turn browsers into buyers</li></ul><p>For those in retailing and marketing, <i>Why We Buy</i> is a remarkably fresh guide, offering creative and insightful tips on how to adapt to the changing customer. For the general public, <i>Why We Buy</i> is a funny and sometimes disconcerting look at our favorite pastime.</p></p><p>In an effort to determine why people buy, Paco Underhill and his detailed-oriented band of retail researchers have camped out in stores over the course of 20 years, dedicating their lives to the "science of shopping." Armed with an array of video equipment, store maps, and customer-profile sheets, Underhill and his consulting firm, Envirosell, have observed over 900 aspects of interaction between shopper and store. They've discovered that men who take jeans into fitting rooms are more likely to buy than females (65 percent vs. 25 percent). They've learned how the "butt-brush factor" (bumped from behind, shoppers become irritated and move elsewhere) makes women avoid narrow aisles. They've quantified the importance of shopping baskets; contact between employees and shoppers; the "transition zone" (the area just inside the store's entrance); and "circulation patterns" (how shoppers move throughout a store). And they've explored the relationship between a customer's amenability and profitability, learning how good stores capitalize on a shopper's unspoken inclinations and desires.<p> Underhill, whose clients include McDonald's, Starbucks, Est�e Lauder, and Blockbuster, stocks <i>Why We Buy</i> with a wealth of retail insights, showing how men are beginning to shop like women, and how women have changed the way supermarkets are laid out. He also looks to the future, projecting massive retail opportunities with an aging baby-boom population and predicting how online retailing will affect shopping malls. This lighthearted look at shopping is highly recommended to anyone who buys or sells. <i>--Rob McDonald</i></p>Paco Underhill is the founder and CEO of Envirosell, Inc.

"Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore through the curtain. The world opened before the knight-errant in all the comical nakedness of its prose." For Kundera, that curtain represents a ready-made perception of the world that each of us has&#x2014;a pre-interpreted world. The job of the novelist, he argues, is to rip through the curtain and reveal what it hides.</p><p>In this entertaining and always stimulating essay, Kundera cleverly sketches out his personal view of the history and value of the novel in Western civilization. Too often, he suggests, a novel is thought about only within the confines of the language and nation of its origin, when in fact the novel's development has always occurred across borders: Laurence Sterne learned from Rabelais, Henry Fielding from Cervantes, Joyce from Flaubert, Garc�a M�rquez from Kafka. The real work of a novel is not bound up in the specifics of any one language: what makes a novel matter is its ability to reveal some previously unknown aspect of our existence. In <em>The Curtain</em>, Kundera skillfully describes how the best novels do just that.</p></p><p><p>Milan Kundera is the author of the novels <em>The Joke, Farewell Waltz, Life Is Elsewhere, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>, and <em>Immortality</em>, and the short-story collection <em>Laughable Loves</em>&#x2014;all originally written in Czech. His most recent novels <em>Slowness, Identity, and Ignorance</em>, as well as his nonfiction works <em>The Art of the Novel, Testaments Betrayed, The Curtain,</em> and <em>Encounter</em>, were originally written in French.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> It's not often that a work comes along that so perfectly distills an approach to art that it realigns the way an art form is understood. Susan Sontag's revolutionary work <i>On Photography</i> was one such piece. Kundera's new book-length essay should be another. The renowned Franco-Czech author (<i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i>) investigates the history of the novel, beginning with the moment in which Cervantes denied Don Quixote's desire for elevation to knight-errant and instead "cast a legendary figure down: into the world of prose." In the prosaic world, according to Kundera, the absence of pathos, the insistence on the comedic and the interrelation of all novels represent the locus of meaning and emotional impact. Kundera argues against the tendency to classify and study literature through the lens of nationality. Instead, he proposes a world literature that would take into account the way novelists learn from one another, Sterne from Rabelais, Fielding from Cervantes, Joyce from Flaubert and, though he never explicitly states it, Kundera from them all. This is a self-consciously personal vision of "the poetics of the novel," one that displays Kundera's own preoccupations, from his Central European dislike of sentimental kitsch to his exhortation that, to be counted in the history of the novel, all novelists must follow Cervantes, must "[tear] the curtain of preinterpretation" into which we are all born. Only then can the novel accomplish its purpose: to show its readers their own lives. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Victor Narraway, his companion, swore. Pitt regained his balance as they gathered speed towards Aldgate and Whitechapel High Street. The horse&#x2019;s hooves struck hard on the cobbles and ahead of them traffic was scattering out of the way. Thank heaven this early there was little enough of it: a few costermongers&#x2019; carts with fruit and vegetables, a brewer&#x2019;s dray, goods wagons, and one horse-drawn omnibus.<br><br>&#x201c;Right!&#x201d; Narraway shouted at the driver. &#x201c;Commercial Road! It&#x2019;s faster!&#x201d;<br><br>The driver obeyed without answering. It was fifteen minutes before six on a summer morning and there were already laborers, hawkers, tradesmen, and domestic servants about. Please heaven they would be in Myrdle Street before six o&#x2019;clock!<br><br>Pitt felt as if his heart were beating in his throat. The call had come just over half an hour ago, but it felt like an eternity. The telephone had woken him and he had gone racing downstairs in his nightshirt. Narraway&#x2019;s voice had been crackly and breathless on the other end. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve sent a cab for you. Meet me on Cornhill, north side, outside the Royal Exchange. Immediately. Anarchists are going to bomb a house on Myrdle Street.&#x201d; Then he had hung up without waiting for a reply, leaving Pitt to go back upstairs and tell Charlotte before he scrambled into his clothes. She had run downstairs and fetched him a glass of milk and a slice of bread, but there had been no time for tea.<br><br>He had stood a cold, impatient five minutes on the pavement outside the Royal Exchange until Narraway&#x2019;s cab arrived and slithered to a halt. Then the driver&#x2019;s long whip snaked out and urged the horse forward again even before Pitt had fallen into the other seat.<br><br>Now they were charging towards Myrdle Street and he still had very little idea what it was about, except that the information had come from Narraway&#x2019;s own sources on the fringes of the seething East End underworld&#x2014;the province of cracksmen, macers, screevers, footpads, and the swarming thieves of every kind that preyed on the river.<br><br>&#x201c;Why Myrdle Street?&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be anyone,&#x201d; Narraway replied without taking his eyes off the road. Special Branch had been created originally to deal with Irish Fenians in London, but now they dealt with all threats to the safety of the country. Just at the moment&#x2014;early summer 1893&#x2014;the danger at the front of most people&#x2019;s minds was anarchist bombers. There had been several incidents in Paris, and London had suffered half a dozen explosions of one degree or another.<br><br>Narraway had no idea whether this latest threat came from the Irish, who were still pursuing Home Rule, or revolutionaries simply desiring to overthrow the government, the throne, or law and order in general.<br><br>They swung left around the corner up into Myrdle Street, across the junction, and stopped. Just up ahead the police were busy waking people up, hurrying them out of their homes and into the road. There was no time to look for treasured possessions, not even to grasp onto more than a coat or a shawl against the cool air of the morning.<br><br>Pitt saw a constable of about twenty chivvying along an old woman. Her white hair hung in thin wisps over her shoulders, her arthritic feet bare on the cobbles. Suddenly he almost choked with fury against whoever was doing this.<br><br>A small boy wandered across the street, blinking in bewilderment, dragging a mongrel puppy on a length of string.<br><br>Narraway was out of the cab and striding towards the nearest constable, Pitt on his heels. The constable swiveled around to tell him to go back, his face flushed with anxiety and annoyance. &#x201c;Yer gotta get out o&#x2019; the way, sir.&#x201d; He waved his arm. &#x201c;Well back, sir. There&#x2019;s a bomb in one o&#x2019; . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know!&#x201d; Narraway said smartly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Victor Narraway, head of Special Branch. This is my associate, Thomas Pitt. Do you know where the bomb is?&#x201d;<br><br>The constable stood half to attention, still holding his right hand out to bar people from returning to their homes in the still, almost breathless morning air. &#x201c;No sir,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Not to be exact. We reckon it&#x2019;s gotter be one o&#x2019; them two over there.&#x201d; He inclined his head towards the opposite side of the street. Narrow, three-story houses huddled together, doors wide open, front steps whitened by proud, hardworking women. A cat wandered out of one of them, and a child shouted to it eagerly and it ran towards her.<br><br>&#x201c;Is everyone out?&#x201d; Narraway demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, far as we can tell&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The rest of his answer was cut off by a shattering explosion. It came at first like a sharp crack, and then a roar and a tearing and crumbling. A huge chunk of one of the houses lifted in the air then blew apart. Rubble fell crashing into the street and over other roofs, smashing slates and toppling chimneys. Dust and flames filled the air. People were shouting hysterically. Someone was screaming.<br><br>The constable was shouting too, his mouth wide open, but his words were lost in the noise. His body staggered oddly as if his legs would not obey him. He lurched forward, waving his arms as people stood rooted to the ground in horror.<br><br>Another blast roared somewhere inside the second house. The walls shivered and seemed to subside upon themselves, bricks and plaster falling outward. Then there was more flame, black smoke gushing up.<br><br>Suddenly people started to run. Children were sobbing, someone was cursing loudly, and several dogs burst into frenzied barking. An old man was swearing steadily at everything he could think of, repeating himself over and over.<br><br>Narraway&#x2019;s face was white, his black eyes like holes in his head. They had never expected to be able to prevent the bombs going off, but it was still a searing defeat to see such wreckage strewn across the road, and terrified and bewildered people stumbling around. The flames were getting hold of the dry lath and timber and beginning to spread.<br><br>A fire engine pulled up, its horses sweating, their eyes rolling. Men leapt out and started to uncoil the big, canvas hoses, but it was going to be a hopeless task.<br><br>Pitt felt a stunning sense of failure. Special Branch was for preventing things like this. And now that it had happened there was nothing comforting or purposeful he could do. He did not even know if there would be a third bomb, or a fourth.<br><br>Another constable came sprinting along the street, arms waving wildly, his helmet jammed crookedly on his head. &#x201c;Other side!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re getting away on the other side!&#x201d;<br><br>It was a moment before Pitt realized what he meant.<br><br>Narraway knew immediately. He twisted on his heel and started back towards the hansom.<br><br>Pitt galvanized into action, catching up with Narraway just as he swung up into the cab, barking at the driver to go back to Fordham Street and turn east.<br><br>The man obeyed instantly, snaking the long carriage whip over the horse&#x2019;s back and urging it forward. They went to the left, crossed Essex Street barely hesitating, and glimpsed another hansom disappearing north up New Road towards Whitechapel.<br><br>&#x201c;After them!&#x201d; Narraway shouted, ignoring the morning traffic of delivery carts and drays, which swerved out of their way and jammed together.<br><br>There had been no time to ask who the bombers might be, but as they slewed around the corner into Whitechapel Road, and past the London Hospital, Pitt turned his mind to it. The anarchist threats so far had been disorganized and no specific demands had been made. London was the capital of an empire that stretched across almost every continent on the earth, and the islands between, and it was also the biggest port in the world. There was a constant influx of every nationality under the sun&#x2014;recently in particular immigrants had arrived from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, seeking to escape the power of the tsar. Others from Spain and Italy, and especially France, had more socialist aims in mind.<br><br>Beside him Narraway was craning forward, his lean body rigid. His face turned first one way then the other as he sought to catch a glimpse of the hansom ahead. Whitechapel had turned into Mile End Road. They passed the huge block of Charrington&#x2019;s Brewery on the left.<br><br>&#x201c;It makes no damn sense!&#x201d; he said bitterly.<br><br>The cab ahead of them turned left up Peters Street. It had barely straightened when it disappeared to the right into Willow Place and then Long Spoon Lane. Pitt and Narraway&#x2019;s cab overshot and had to turn and double back. By that time there were two more cabs slithering to a halt with policemen piling out of them, and the original cab had gone.<br><br>Long Spoon Lane was narrow and cobbled. Its gray tenement buildings rose up sheer for three stories, grimy, stained with the smoke and damp of generations. The air smelled of wet rot and old sewage.<br><br>Pitt glanced along both sides, east and west. Several doorways were boarded up. A large woman stood blocking another, hands on her hips, glaring at the disturbance to her routine. To the west one door slammed, but when two constables charged with their shoulders to it, it did not budge. They tried again and again with no effect.<br><br>&#x201c;It must be barricaded,&#x201d; Narraway said grimly. &#x201c;Get back!&#x201d; he ordered the men.<br><br>Pitt felt a chill. Narraway must fear the anarchists were armed. It was absurd. Less than two hours ago he had been lying in bed half-asleep, Charlotte&#x2019;s hair a dark river across the pillow beside him. The early sunlight had made a bright bar between the curtains, and busy sparrows chattered in the trees outside. Now he stood shivering as he stared up at the ugly wall of a tenement building...</p><h2>Celestial Sampler: 60 Small-Scope Tours for Starlit Nights (Stargazing)</h2><p>Take a tour of the universe with Sky &amp; Telescope Contributing Editor Sue French.

No, actually I didn&#x2019;t want to die. Or live. I just didn&#x2019;t care. Dying would have been better than puking my guts out again in a bucket. Which wouldn&#x2019;t have been so bad if the bucket hadn&#x2019;t been inside a freezing Flying Fortress halfway between Iceland and England, trying to ride out a North Atlantic storm. And if there hadn&#x2019;t been a war going on, and I hadn&#x2019;t been headed right for it.<br><br>I wanted to reach for the bucket again but the floor dropped out from under me as the Fortress was pounded by powerful, howling storm winds that seemed to scream at the fuselage, clawing at the plane&#x2019;s skin for a way inside. Canvascovered crates bounced on each other, held down by knotted ropes and the weight of what they carried. I worried about being crushed to death before I ever got to England, a crate of beans or grenades or whatever was important enough to rate air transport ending my military career. The waist gunner openings were closed up. Only a small Perspex window let in what little light there was among the gray clouds at twenty thousand feet. The noise from the storm and the four straining engines pounded in my head like a jackhammer<br>orchestra. I prayed for the plane to steady itself and held on to the hard metal seat for dear life. All I could think about was the fact that, just two days before, I was fat, dumb, and happy, just about to graduate from Officer Candidate School, and ready to enjoy the delights of life as a staff officer at the War Department in Washington, D.C. I was all set. The fix was in. Now I was in a fix.<br><br>I never wanted to be in the army. I was happy as a cop on the beat in Boston, just like my dad and my uncles, and seldom even left South Boston, where the Boyle family lived and worked. I had been on the job for three years, and my dad and his brothers&nbsp;and their pals watched out for me. That&#x2019;s how it works. The rich folks on Beacon Hill look out for their own and the Irish in Southie look out for theirs. I guess it&#x2019;s like that all over the world, but I really don&#x2019;t know. Or care. That&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s problem.<br><br>My problem was that I had just made detective three days before Pearl Harbor. It was unusual for a kid in his early twenties to make the grade. The test they gave was pretty hard. While I can usually figure things out sooner or later, I&#x2019;m no scholar. I would&#x2019;ve had a hard time, but a few of the sheets from the test sort of found their way into my locker a couple of days before the exam. I managed to pass. My uncle Dan is on the promotions board, so with a little backscratching with his buddies over a few pints of Guinness, I was in. That&#x2019;s just the way it works. I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m proud of it, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m not a good cop either. It&#x2019;s not a bad system, actually. The other guys know me and know they can depend on me. I&#x2019;m not some stranger who got the job just because he&#x2019;s smart enough to answer a bunch of questions on his own. That doesn&#x2019;t mean squat when you need your partner to back you up. Three years walking the beat in Chinatown and around the harbor had taught me a lot, not to mention everything Dad tried to drum into my head. He&#x2019;s a homicide detective, and he always made sure I got assigned to a crime scene when they needed some extra bluecoats for crowd control or knocking on doors. I worked a lot of overtime, saw a lot of dead bodies, and listened to Dad talk me through his routine. Sometimes it was obvious who the killer was, like after a knife fight between drunks. Other times, it wasn&#x2019;t. Watching Dad figure things out was like watching an artist paint a picture. He used to say an investigation was a lot like art, just a blank canvas and a whole lot of different colors in little jars. All the clues were there, just like a painting was already in those little jars of paint. But you had to mix them together and put them on the canvas right, so it all made sense. Well, the only thing I can paint is a house, and sometimes I couldn&#x2019;t see how Dad figured things out, even when he explained it all to me. But he would always go through it with me afterward, hoping some of it would stick.<br><br>Anyway, I was pretty disappointed to hear about Pearl Harbor. It was tough for those guys out there, but it also meant the draft board was going to come after me. The<br>Boston PD had more cops than deferments, and we younger guys knew what was coming. I didn&#x2019;t like it much, but it looked like Uncle Sam was going to ship me off to fight the Japs. Everybody was all worked up over the Japs, but it seemed to me that I had enough problems with the Chinese gangs down in Chinatown without taking on the rest of the Orient.<br><br>I thought maybe the military police would be a good choice, to stay in the game sort of. Dad nixed that idea right away. He&#x2019;d hated the MPs he&#x2019;d run into in France during the First World War and said no son of his would ever earn his keep busting poor enlisted men over a drink or the ladies. OK, that was that.<br><br>Uncle Dan didn&#x2019;t want me to go at all. He and Dad went off to war in 1917 with their older brother, Frank. Frank got killed his first day at the front. It broke Grandma&#x2019;s<br>heart and I think Dad and Uncle Dan&#x2019;s, too. I never really knew how hard it had hit them until one night over drinks at Kirby&#x2019;s Bar, right after New Year&#x2019;s, just a month after Pearl Harbor. I could tell they were working up to tell me something. It took a couple of Bushmills Irish whiskeys before they got around to it.<br><br>&#x201c;If somebody comes after the Boyles, then it&#x2019;s personal, and we all back each other up,&#x201d; my dad started. &#x201c;You know that, Billy. But this war, it&#x2019;s no good for us. The Boyles have finally made it here. No one ever helped us, especially when Da couldn&#x2019;t get work because &#x2018;No Irish Need Apply.&#x2019; We&#x2019;ve worked hard to build something for you here, and we&#x2019;re not going to let this war with the Japs and Germans take it away from you. It&#x2019;s not our war. No one attacked Boston or Ireland. So we&#x2019;re going to find a way to keep you safe. We don&#x2019;t want you to get killed, like Frank.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially not fighting for the fucking English, Billy,you remember that,&#x201d; Uncle Dan chimed in. Like any good IRA man, he hated the English. It had galled him to fight on<br>the same side as the English in his war, and he didn&#x2019;t want me to do the same in mine. Unfortunately, their plan didn&#x2019;t go any farther than deciding I shouldn&#x2019;t get killed, which sounded fine to me. We drank some more, and went home. Dad got yelled at. I went to sleep.<br><br>In the morning we went to Mass. That always calmed Mom down, and she was nice to Dad as we walked home from church. That&#x2019;s when she got the idea. Her second cousin, one of the Doud clan that had moved to Colorado, was married to a general who worked at the War Plans Division of the War Department in Washington, D.C. Maybe he&#x2019;d give me some sort of job there. I&#x2019;d seen him last at a family wedding a few years ago. Since he was an older guy I called him &#x201c;Uncle.&#x201d; Uncle Ike.<br><br>The Boyle family put the wheels into motion. Dad called our congressman, Teddy McCarrick, who owed him for certain favors granted during the election. Teddy was glad to oblige, knowing there was always another election around the corner. Not only did I get an immediate qualification for Officer Candidate School, but he called a week later and told Dad that my uncle had asked Army Personnel to assign me to his staff as soon as I graduated OCS. Well, all right! On my uncle&#x2019;s staff in the nation&#x2019;s capital, where the women outnumbered the men ten to one and I&#x2019;d be an officer and a gentleman. Not bad for an Irish kid from Boston. A lot better than a grave in France, according to Uncle Dan.<br><br>We only forgot one thing. The part of OCS that stood for &#x201c;School.&#x201d; I did fine in basic training. I&#x2019;d always played sports and kept in shape. I knew firearms, which is more than I can say about the other guys in boot camp. I figured it was more dangerous around the firing range there than anyplace I&#x2019;d ever see in this war. But then we went to school. Never liked it, never will. It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of school where you could bullshit your way out of trouble, like I&#x2019;d done many times back home. They really expected you to learn this stuff: map reading, tactics, command, logistics. It gave me a headache. I kept hoping that I&#x2019;d find the exam answers slipped under my door, but this wasn&#x2019;t Boston, and the noncoms were all Southern boys. Not an Irish guy among them.<br><br>Somehow, I made it. Rock bottom out of my company, but I made it. Before we got our bars my drill instructor told me I was the dumbest Irish Mick he had ever seen, and that was saying something. I thanked him for the compliment and thought, Imagine how surprised he&#x2019;ll be tomorrow when we get our orders, and I go off to the War Plans Division. Ha! I&#x2019;ll show him!<br><br>We got our orders all right, and Sarge really was surprised. So was I. I wasn&#x2019;t going to D.C. I was going to London goddamn England, to the headquarters of the U.S. Army<br>European Theater of Operations, General Dwight David Eisenhower commanding. Uncle Ike. In charge of the whole shooting match. Why, I had not a clue. I love my mom, but I had to think that maybe this was not one of her best ideas. The plane stopped rocking and lurching. The storm had calmed down, and so did my stomach. The sun rose, or we caught up with it, and things started improving. We descended through white clouds, and when I went up to the cockpit I actually enjoyed the view. I was the only passenger, not because I was special, but because a Flying Fortress bomber was not meant to be a passenger plane. I had AAA travel priority, so I had been put on the first flight out of the States headed f...</p><h2>Herrschner&#39;s Blue-Ribbon Afghans (Crochet Treasury)</h2><p>Create beautiful, award-winning afghans with HERRSCHNER&#39;S BLUE RIBBON AFGHANS.

In the end, though, who would want to?<p>This zany tale of upholsterosis (a chronic state of couch-potato-ness) is sure to tickle the funny bones of young readersand not-so-young-readers too!</p></p><p>David Slonim is the author-illustrator of Oh Ducky! and the illustrator of Emily and Albert by Jan Ormerod and Moishe&#39;s Miracle by Laura Krauss Melmed, which was a New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he lives in Indiana with his wife and their four children. His daughter, Mary, was the inspiration for the character of Sophie in He Came with the Couch.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Sophie's family needs a new couch. After a full day of searching, they finally find one that is just right. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, it comes with an odd-looking creature that just sits in the middle of the cushion. Resembling one of Jim Henson's Muppets, the creature, readers learn, suffers from upholsterosis and on doctor's orders that they get him out more, the family takes the sofa and the newcomer on a cross-country journey. Slonim's very funny picture book will appeal to children with a taste for the zany. Told from Sophie's point of view, the understated text is often at hilarious juxtaposition with the illustrations. The colorful artwork will appeal to fans of David Shannon's work as will the tongue-in-cheek storytelling.

There are three different ethnic groups. The Hutu form the biggest group, and they&#x2019;re short with wide noses.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Like Donatien?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, he&#x2019;s from Zaire, that&#x2019;s different. Like our cook, Proth�, for instance. There are also the Twa pygmies. But we won&#x2019;t worry about them, there are so few they don&#x2019;t really count. And then there are the Tutsi, like your mother. The Tutsi make up a much smaller group than the Hutu, they&#x2019;re tall and skinny with long noses and you never know what&#x2019;s going on inside their heads. Take you, Gabriel,&#x2019; he said, pointing at me, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re a proper Tutsi: we can never tell what you&#x2019;re thinking.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea what I was thinking, either. What&#x2019;s anyone supposed to make of all this? So I asked a question instead:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The war between Tutsis and Hutus . . . is it because</p><p>they don&#x2019;t have the same land?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, they have the same country.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;So . . . they don&#x2019;t have the same language?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, they speak the same language.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;So, they don&#x2019;t have the same God?&#x2019; &#x2018;No, they have the same God.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;So . . . why are they at war?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Because they don&#x2019;t have the same nose.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that was the end of the discussion. It was all very odd. I&#x2019;m not sure Papa really understood it, either. From that day on, I started noticing people&#x2019;s noses in the street, as well as how tall they were. When my little sister Ana and I went shopping in town, we tried to be subtle about guessing who was a Hutu and who was a Tutsi.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The guy in white trousers is a Hutu,&#x2019; we would whisper, &#x2018;he&#x2019;s short with a wide nose.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Right, and the one towering over everybody in a hat, he&#x2019;s extra-skinny with a long nose, so he must be a Tutsi.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;See that man over there, in the striped shirt? He&#x2019;s a Hutu.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, he&#x2019;s not &#x2013; look, he&#x2019;s tall and skinny.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Yes, but he&#x2019;s got a wide nose!&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s when we began to have our suspicions about ethnic labels. Anyway, Papa didn&#x2019;t want us talking about it. He thought children should stay out of politics. But we couldn&#x2019;t help it. The atmosphere was becoming stranger by the day. At school, fights broke out at the slightest provocation, with friends calling each other &#x2018;Hutu&#x2019; or &#x2018;Tutsi&#x2019; as an insult. When we were all watching <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, one student was even overheard saying: &#x2018;Look at him, with a nose like that he&#x2019;s got to be Tutsi.&#x2019; Something in the air had changed. And you could smell it, no matter what kind of nose you had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am haunted by the idea of returning. Not a day goes by without the country calling to me. A secret sound, a scent on the breeze, a certain afternoon light, a gesture, sometimes silence is enough to stir my childhood memories. &#x2018;You won&#x2019;t find anything there, apart from ghosts and a pile of ruins,&#x2019; Ana keeps telling me. She refuses to hear another word about that &#x2018;cursed country&#x2019;. I listen and I believe her. She&#x2019;s always been more clear-headed than I. So I put it out of my mind. I decide, once and for all, that I&#x2019;m never going back. My life is here. In France.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except that I no longer live anywhere. Living somewhere means a physical merging with its landscape, with every crevice of its environment. There&#x2019;s none of that here. I&#x2019;m passing through. I rent. I crash. I squat. My town is a dormitory that serves its purpose. My apartment smells of fresh paint and new linoleum. My neighbours are perfect strangers, we avoid each other politely in the stairwell.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live and work just outside Paris. In Saint-Quentin-en- Yvelines. RER line C. This new town is like a life without a past. It took me years to feel &#x2018;integrated&#x2019;. To hold down a stable job, an apartment, hobbies, friendships.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy connecting with people online. Encounters that last an evening or a few weeks. The girls who date me are all different, each one beautiful in her own way. I feel intoxicated listening to them, inhaling the fragrance of their hair, before surrendering to the warm oblivion of their arms, their legs, their bodies. Not one of them fails to ask me the same loaded question, and it&#x2019;s always on our first date: &#x2018;So, where are you from?&#x2019; A question as mundane as it is predictable. It feels like an obligatory rite-of-passage, before the relationship can develop any further. My skin &#x2013; the colour of caramel &#x2013; must explain itself by offering up its pedigree. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a human being.&#x2019; My answer rankles with them. Not that I&#x2019;m trying to be provocative. Any more than I want to appear pedantic or philosophical. But when I was just knee- high to a locust, I had already made up my mind never to define myself again.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening progresses. My technique is smooth. They talk. They enjoy being listened to. I am drunk. Deep in my cups. Drowning in alcohol, I shrug off sincerity. I become a fearsome hunter. I make them laugh. I seduce them. Just for fun, I return to the question of my roots, deliberately keeping the mystery alive. We play at cat-and-mouse. I inform them, with cold cynicism, that my identity can be weighed in corpses. They don&#x2019;t react. They try to keep things light. They stare at me with doe-like eyes. I want them. Sometimes, they give themselves up. They take me for a bit of a character. But I can entertain them for only so long.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am haunted by the idea of returning but I keep put- ting it off, indefinitely. There&#x2019;s the fear of buried truths, of nightmares left on the threshold of my native land. For twenty years I&#x2019;ve been going back there &#x2013; in my dreams at night, as well as in the magical thinking of my days &#x2013; back to my neighbourhood, to our street where I lived happily with my family and friends. My childhood has left its marks on me, and I don&#x2019;t know what to do about this. On good days, I tell myself it has contributed to my being strong and sensitive. But when I&#x2019;m staring at the bottom of a bottle, I blame my childhood for my failure to adapt to the world.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life is one long meandering. Everything interests me. Nothing ignites my passion. There&#x2019;s no fire in my belly. I belong to the race of slouchers, of averagely inert citizens. Every now and again I have to pinch myself. I notice the way I behave in company, at work, with my office col- leagues. Is that guy in the lift mirror really me? The young man forcing a laugh by the coffee machine? I don&#x2019;t recognise him. I have come from so far that I still feel astonished to be here. My colleagues talk about the weather or what&#x2019;s on TV. I can&#x2019;t listen to them anymore. I&#x2019;m having trouble breathing. I loosen my shirt collar. My clothes restrict me. I stare at my polished shoes: they gleam, offering a disappointing reflection. What&#x2019;s become of my feet? They&#x2019;re in hiding. I never walk barefoot outdoors any more these days. I wander over to the window. Under the low-hanging sky, and through the grey sticky drizzle, there&#x2019;s not a single mango tree in the tiny park wedged between the shopping centre and the railway lines.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular evening, on leaving work, I run for refuge to the nearest bar, opposite the station. I sit down by the table- football and order a whisky to mark my thirty-third birth- day. I try ringing Ana, but she&#x2019;s not answering her mobile. I refuse to give up, re-dialling her number several times, until I remember she&#x2019;s on a business trip in London. I want to talk to her, to tell her about the phone call I received this morning. It&#x2019;s a sign. I have to return, if only to be clear in my own mind. To bring this obsessive story to an end, once and for all. To close the door behind me. I order another whisky. The noise from the television above the bar temporarily drowns out my thoughts. A 24-hour news channel is broadcasting images of people fleeing war. I witness their makeshift boats washing up on European soil. The children who dis- embark are frozen, starving, dehydrated. Their lives played out on the global football pitch of insanity. Whisky in hand, I watch them from the comfort of the VIP Box. Public opinion holds that they&#x2019;ve fled hell to find El Dorado. Bullshit! What about the country inside them? &#x2013; nobody ever mentions that. Poetry may not be news. But it is all that human beings retain from their journey on this earth. I look away from images that capture reality, if not the truth. Perhaps those children will write the truth, one day. I&#x2019;m as gloomy as a motorway service station in winter. Every birthday it&#x2019;s the same: this intense melancholy that comes crashing down on me, like a tropical downpour, when I think about Papa, Maman, my friends, and that never-ending party with the crocodile at the bottom of our garden . . .</i></p></p><h2>The Journey is the Destination: The Journals of Dan Eldon</h2><p>By the time he was twenty-two, Dan Eldon had led a relief mission across Africa; worked as a graphic designer in New York; studied (intermittently) at four colleges; traveled through Europe, Africa, Japan, and the US; founded a charity for Mozambiquan refugees; directed a film; written a book; started up his own photography business; and become a photojournalist for Reuters news agency, covering the famine and civil war in Somalia. There, in 1993, he was killed in an eruption of mob violence while on assignment. In a world of rules and regularity, Eldon was a renegade, a risk-taker, and an adventurer. But, despite all his travels, he knew that the interior landscape is the only one truly worth exploring, and this is the journey he dedicated himself to recording. His is no ordinary journal; it is an astonishing seventeen-volume collage of photos, drawings, words, maps, clippings, paint, scraps, shards, and trash that reveals his strange and vivid life. <i>The Journey is the Destination</i> offers a selection of pages from these extraordinary journals, at once the vision of an artist in his prime and the unrestrained outpourings of a young man just beginning to live.</p><p>Dan Eldon, who was only 22 when he was chased down and killed by an angry mob in Somalia, was one of the youngest photographic stringers in Africa. But his journalistic work, which had appeared in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>, showed only a small part of his talent. Eldon excelled as an artist in his collages, which combined his photographs of Africa with paint, pastiche, pop culture images, advertising, and official documents. <i>The Journey Is the Destination</i> collects pages from the 17 scrapbooks that held his art. Chronicling his work from age 14 through his death at 22, this volume is startling not only in the intensity and thoughtfulness of the pages, but also in the fact that someone so young could have this kind of artistic depth and insight.Dan Eldon was born in London in 1970 and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. His photographs of Somalia's brutal famine, published in newspapers worldwide, helped trigger the world's conscience.

According to Catherine MacCoun, alchemy is no mere metaphor. It&#x2019;s real magic. Transforming the inner world is, for the alchemist, a way to transform the outer world. Through studying the principles of alchemy, we can achieve extraordinary effects from ordinary actions by understanding how the world really works. We can perceive the hidden connections between the spiritual and the material worlds. Knowledge of these connections enables us to influence external phenomena through the powers of heart and mind alone. Yet alchemy is not, like some forms of magic, the exercise of mind over matter. It is the art of taking what already exists&#x2014;whatever presents itself&#x2014;and transmuting the harmful into the helpful, the useless into the valuable.</p><p><i>On Becoming an Alchemist</i> initiates us into these secrets, showing us how to think, perceive, and operate as an alchemist. It offers practical advice and exercises that will help the modern magician to: <br><br> &#x25cf; Understand and apply basic principles of alchemy <br>&#x25cf; Transmute setbacks, failures, and losses into sources of magical power <br>&#x25cf; Navigate one&#x2019;s inner world with poise, confidence, and common sense <br>&#x25cf; Intuitively show up in the right place at the right time to benefit from magical coincidences <br>&#x25cf; Discover the potentials latent in any situation by awakening subtle perception</p></p><p>Catherine MacCoun is a literary collaborator by profession and has written five published volumes of nonfiction. Her novel, <i>Beyond the Abbey Gates</i>, was originally published as <i>The Age of Miracles</i>, in 1990, and reissued as a Trumpeter book in 2006. She has won numerous grants and awards for her writing, including a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in prose.&#x201c;What MacCoun gives us in her book is a great telling of the workability of magic complete with history, principles, and procedures. She believes that we all have the ability to perform magic, to transform our lives and our world for the better.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Evolve! Magazine</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A richly gratifying exploration of alchemy. MacCoun represents this ancient art as a kind of spiritual graduate school.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br><br>&#x201c;An enchanting, engaging, and insightful work that investigates the power of our creativity and our relationship to the laws of the universe.&#x201d;&#x2014;Caroline Myss, author of<i> Entering the Castle</i> and <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Catherine MacCoun is a great communicator, and she knows her stuff from the inside too. Blows a bright and refreshing breeze through the musty halls of hermetic and magical symbolism, and lays it all on the line. Highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gareth Knight, author of <i>Magic and the Western Mind</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A true alchemist, Catherine MacCoun has transformed profound ideas into a gold standard of what a book on magic should be. Excellently written with prose that sparkles with clarity and wit, this book can serve novice and advanced practitioner alike with equal grace and insight.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Spangler, author of <i>Blessing </i>and<i> Everyday Miracles</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Many discussions of alchemy are hopelessly dense and opaque; this one is full of light and life. With admirable clarity, MacCoun shows how alchemy can benefit one&#x2019;s life here and now. This is uncluttered, everyday wisdom; the most accessible discussion of the psychospiritual dimensions of alchemy to appear in years.&#x201d;&#x2015;Larry Dossey, MD, author of <i>The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things</i></p><h2>Dard Hunter: The Graphic Works</h2><p>The distinctive typography and elegant compositions designed by William Joseph &#x201c;Dard&#x201d; Hunter (American, 1883&#x2013;1966) have become icons of the American Arts and Crafts style and have established him as one of America's most influential graphic artists of the twentieth century.<p>At age 21, Hunter talked his way into a summer job at the famed Roycroft arts community in East Aurora, New York, and ended up staying. He had grown up around printing presses&#x2014;his father was in the newspaper business&#x2014;and had already dabbled with graphic arts. Under the mentorship of Roycroft leader Elbert Hubbard, Hunter forged his own design path, one that initially found its inspiration in William Morris's Kelmscott Press but quickly shifted to modeling contemporary European design trends.</p><p>After marrying in 1908, Hunter and his wife enjoyed an extended visit to Vienna, where he immersed himself in the creative output of Austrian and German Secession artists, and the products of the Vienna Workshop (Wiener Werkstatte). In a letter home, Hunter wrote, &#x201c;I think it's up to me to do from the U.S. what these fellows have done from [Vienna].&#x201d; The couple returned to Vienna in 1910 so that Hunter could attend a prestigious graphic arts school.</p><p>In England in 1911, Hunter became fascinated with making handmade paper, a craft that had ceased to exist in the United States. He moved to Marlborough, New York, a year later, where he built a paper mill and became the reigning expert on papermaking, eventually writing eighteen books on the subject.</p><p>But Hunter's graphic art is what remains instantly recognizable and beloved today. <i>Dard Hunter: The Graphic Works</i> features more than 80 of his designs for book covers and title pages, booklets, bookplates, brochures, letterheads, and stained glass windows. Accompanied by historical photographs and examples from Hunter's design contemporaries, author Lawrence Kreisman's illuminating text establishes Hunter as a unique voice that emerged from a multitude of extraordinary influences in an incomparable era of flourishing artistic achievement.</p></p><p>LAWRENCE KREISMAN, M.A., M.

Originally published between 1916 and 1930, <em>Thuvia, Maid of Mars; The Chessmen of Mars; The Master Mind of Mars;</em> and <em>A Fighting Man of Mars</em> are science fiction classics which introduce new characters and adventures to the dangerous martian landscape.</p><p><br>Edgar Rice Burroughs, 1875-1950<br><br>Edgar Rice Burroughs is renowed for his many novels of fantastic adventure. Unquestionably his best-known creation is that of the jungle hero, Tarzan the Ape Man, but almost as well known are his stories of other planets beginning with the very popular Mars series. A torrent of novels followed: stories about Venus, tales of the Moon and of the middle Earth, westerns, and detective stories. In all, nearly one hundred stories bore Edgar Rice Burroughs' name.<br><br>Born in Chicago in 1875, he tried his hand at many businesses without notable success, until at the age of thirty-five, he turned to writing. With the publication of Tarzan of the Apes and A Princess of Mars, his career was assured.

He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler. </p>"Justice gets served last, and usually winds up with leftovers." Yes, it's witty, but what really makes this line work is that the man speaking it, bookstore owner and master burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, finds not just irony but opportunity in its meaning. That's the thing about the Rhodenbarr mysteries: Bernie keeps you on your toes. He has a heart of gold, but he loves to steal, both for the thrill and the profit. Sentimental, yes, but selfish, too, thank God--sort of like Bogart, which leads us to the just-plain-fun plot of Bernie's latest caper. Out of all the bookstores in all the towns in all the world, this girl named Ilona happens to walk into Bernie's: they get to talking, she buys a book on Bogart, and before you can say, "Here's looking at you, kid," they've made a date to see two Bogey flicks at a New York film festival. After that, it gets complicated fast: they keep going to the Bogey festival every night; Bernie steals some documents; his sort-of-partner is killed; an enigmatic fat man appears, lusting after the documents; Ilona disappears, leaving Bernie holding the popcorn; and, inevitably, Ilona takes the midnight plane, dedicating her life to helping another man achieve an idealistic political dream, but not before Bernie has a chance to mutter, "We'll always have Twenty-fifth Street." What does it all mean? Not much, but if you're a film fan, who cares? It's funny, it's silly, it's stupendously clever, it's drop-dead romantic. Play it again, Bernie. <i>Bill Ott</i></p><h2>Wildflowers: Designs for Appliqu� &amp; Quilting</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

A wealth of former associates lend their voices and recollections to an account that steps far beyond the tried and tested tales of Zeppelin's life and times.<br><br>This all-new biography details Plant's early years as an unknown in Birmingham, England, with fresh depth and insight. It likewise tells the Zeppelin story from new and unexpected angles, focusing on Plant's contributions to the band's success and on the toll/effect of that success on him as a performer and an individual.<br><br>After drummer John Bonham died in 1980 and Zeppelin broke up, Plant went solo two years later, in time becoming the only former band member to maintain an unbroken career to this day. His single-mindedness in meeting this challenge might well be his greatest personal attribute, enabling him to push forward without regard for his past or any related expectations. Dave Thompson shows how it is Plant's determination alone that ensured Zeppelin reunions would not become a routine part of the classic rock furniture, as he created a body of work that in so many ways artistically rivals what he recorded with the band.</p><p><b>Dave Thompson</b> (Newark, DE) is the author of over 100 books on rock and pop culture, including <i>Roger Waters: The Man Behind the Wall</i> and <i>Hearts of Darkness: James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Cat Stevens, and the Unlikely Rise of the Singer-Songwriter</i>, both from Backbeat Books.

Auden, Carson McCullers, Jane and Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, and Gypsy Rose Lee, Under One Roof In Wartime America</h2><p>February House is the uncovered story of an extraordinary experiment in communal living, one involving young but already iconic writers -- and the country's best-known burlesque performer -- in a house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn during 1940 and 1941. It was a fevered yearlong party fueled by the appetites of youth and by the shared sense of urgency to take action as artists in the months before America entered the war.<br><br>In spite of the sheer intensity of life at 7 Middagh, the house was for its residents a creative crucible. Carson McCullers's two masterpieces, The Member of the Wedding and The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, were born, bibulously, in Brooklyn. Gypsy Rose Lee, workmanlike by day, party girl by night, wrote her book The G-String Murders in her Middagh Street bedroom. Auden -- who along with Britten was being excoriated at home in England for absenting himself from the war -- presided over the house like a peevish auntie, collecting rent money and dispensing romantic advice. And yet all the while he was composing some of the most important work of his career.<br><br>Sherill Tippins's February House, enlivened by primary sources and an unforgettable story, masterfully recreates daily life at the most fertile and improbable live-in salon of the twentieth century.</p><p>Sherill Tippins has worked as an associate producer for PBS&#x2019;s affiliate in Austin, Texas, and is the coauthor of The Irreverent Guide to New York. She lives in New York City.Preface<br><br>New York is full of old people, struggling to occupy their allotted space despite the pressures of the younger generations pushing in. Elbowed by joggers, hedged in by cyclists, they make their daily odysseys to the supermarket and then retreat to the safety of their homes. As one of tens of thousands of college graduates moving to New York City in the 1970s, I was as oblivious as the next twenty-two-year-old to this segment of the population. A decade later, as a new mother in Brooklyn Heights, a neighborhood of brownstones facing Wall Street across the East River, I merely noted the number of people with aluminum walkers on the sidewalks as I maneuvered my child&#x2019;s stroller around them. A few years on, however, when I began volunteering to deliver meals to the housebound and got to know many of these people as individuals, I began to regret my past indifference.<br><br>Many liked to talk, and I found that I liked to listen. The octogenarian who had covered her walls with her own arresting paintings told me about the silent-film actress who had once lived at the nearby Bossert Hotel and ordered up a milk bath every day. The retired city councilman with the fierce gray eyebrows described the spectacular sunsets, enhanced by post-Depression factory fumes, that he had so enjoyed on his homeward walks over the Brooklyn Bridge. The chain-smoking former navy officer recalled the rich scent of chocolate that used to waft through the streets from a Fulton Street candy factory before World War II. I learned, too, how the Brooklyn Dodgers got their name (Brooklyn residents were once called trolley-dodgers&#x201d; because of the many speeding trolley cars on the borough&#x2019;s streets); how a working-class girl could enjoy a free daily swim at the St. George Hotel&#x2019;s swank saltwater pool (all it took was a doctor&#x2019;s note); and what Irish-American children were told when they found an orange in their Christmas stocking ( Thank Mr. Tammany, not Santy Claus&#x201d;).<br><br>Most intriguing to me, however, were the references to a house that once stood at 7 Middagh Street (pronounced mid-daw), a short, narrow lane at the neighborhood&#x2019;s northeastern tip overlooking the former dockyards and, beyond, New York Harbor. The house had been rented, one neighbor told me, by a group of well-known young poets, novelists, composers, and artists the year before America entered World War II. Aware that enormous devastation lay ahead and determined to continue contributing to the culture as long as possible, they had created an environment for themselves to support and stimulate, inspire and protect just a few blocks from where I lived.<br><br>When I learned that these residents included the poet W. H. Auden, the novelist Carson McCullers, the composer Benjamin Britten, Paul and Jane Bowles, and, of all people, the burlesque artist Gypsy Rose Lee all under thirty-five but already near the apex of their careers my interest was piqued even further. In a pictorial survey of Brooklyn&#x2019;s history, I found a photograph of the house a small, shabby brick and brownstone structure with elaborate Tudor trim. The man who had signed the lease and organized this experiment in communal living turned out to have been George Davis, a fiction editor at Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar who had single-handedly revolutionized the role played by popular magazines in bringing serious literature and avant- garde ideas to the American masses. Davis was known for his attraction to the eccentric in culture, in entertainment, and in his choice of friends. With his encouragement, nights at the Middagh Street house became a fevered year-long party in which New York&#x2019;s artistic elite (Aaron Copland, George Balanchine, Louis Untermeyer, Janet Flanner, and Louise Dahl-Wolfe, among others) mingled with a flood of �migr�s fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe, including the composer Kurt Weill and the singer Lotte Lenya, the artist Salvador Dal� and his wife, Gala, and the entire brilliant family of the Nobel Prize winning novelist Thomas Mann. Days, however, were dedicated to their work writing, composing, painting, and otherwise seeking new answers, new approaches to life in a collapsing world.<br><br>By the winter of 1940 41, 7 Middagh called February House&#x201d; by the diarist Anads Nin because so many of its residents had been born in that month had developed a reputation as the greatest artistic salon of the decade. Denis de Rougemont, the author of Love in the Western World, claimed that all that was new in America in music, painting, or choreography emanated from that house, the only center of thought and art that I found in any large city in the country.&#x201d; Throughout the months of that suspenseful season, as Hitler&#x2019;s armies tightened their hold on Europee and killed or wounded thousands of British citizens in bombing raids, Thomas Mann&#x2019;s son Klaus labored in the Middagh Street dining room, assssssembling essays, poems, short stories, and reviews for Decision, a monthly review of free culture,&#x201d; while upstairs in the parlor, the British �migr�s Benjamin Britten and W. H. Auden worked together on an American&#x201d; opera that would express their hopes for and misgivings about their adopted country. On the third floor, McCullers agonized over the opening paragraphs of The Member of the Wedding, while in the room next door George Davis coached Gypsy on her own project, a comic burlesque mystery novel called The G-String Murders. Bowles, then a composer, wrote a ballet score in the cellar while his wife, Jane, did Auden&#x2019;s typing and wrote her own novel, Two Serious Ladies. Oliver Smith, destined to become one of Broadway&#x2019;s most prolific set designers and producers but then a destitute twenty-two-year-old, washed the dishes, tended the furnace, and, like many youngest children,&#x201d; took on the role of family peacemaker. Auden, one of the greatest poets of his generation, served as housemaster to this lively household which at one point included several circus performers and a chimpanzee collecting the rent, dispensing romantic advice, playing word games with his housemates, and strictly enforcing nighttime curfews all while laying the groundwork for some of the most courageous and original work of his career.<br><br>Perhaps inevitably, the intensity of life at 7 Middagh and the pressures created by the war in Europe led to physical and emotional breakdowns, domestic disputes, and creative crises. Even as the residents succumbed to the pressure of the times, so too did the United States. The attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, provoked America&#x2019;s entry into the fiercest and most destructive war in history a six-year conflagration that killed fifty-five million people before it ended. As the artists of 7 Middagh Street had expected, they were scattered in all directions by these events. Some enlisted as soldiers. Others used their skills to create propaganda, conduct surveys, or entertain the troops. And, in the sweeping changes that took place over the next half-decade, 7 Middagh Street itself disappeared, torn down to make way for the construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Today, nothing remains but an unmarked stretch of sidewalk, a wire fence, and a precipitous drop to the lanes of traffic speeding from one borough to the next.<br><br>What does remain is the work these artists created. The final parts of Auden&#x2019;s book The Double Man, his poems The Dark Years,&#x201d; If I Could Tell You,&#x201d; In Sickness and in Health,&#x201d; and the brilliant and innovative oratorio For the Time Being, were all completed during or inspired by the year at 7 Middagh. The twenty-seven-year-old Benjamin Britten gained both the artistic experience and the emotional growth necessary to create his first great opera, Peter Grimes. Carson McCullers&#x2019;s two final masterpieces, The Member of the Wedding and The Ballad of the Sad Caf�, were born in Brooklyn. Auden&#x2019;s support helped Jane Bowles take the first necessary steps toward completing her only serious novel, while Paul Bowles&#x2019;s jealousy over their relationship spurred him toward the writing of fiction for which he is now largely known. Even Gypsy&#x2019;s G-String Murders, written with the help of her admiring housemates, became a 1941 bestseller, establishing her reputation, not just as a stripper who could write, but as a writer who also knew how to keep an audience entranced.<br><br>Frequently, I go out of my way to pass the dead-end street where the house once stood just to remind myself that these extraordinary artists actually occupied the space I do now living together, arguing, laughing, creating, and using their imaginations to increase others&#x2019; awareness of the issues and choices laid bare in that horrible, horrifying time. If we don&#x2019;t act now, when will we? they asked themselves in choosing this shared creative life. If we don&#x2019;t use our talents to find a new way to live, who will?<br><br>How this houseful of geniuses answered those questions is the story my elderly neighbors wanted me to hear. But the questions themselves are what keep me coming back, dreaming of the house at 7 Middagh.<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Sherill Tippins.

Inspector Rebus investigates, and uncovers old secrets that suggest Scotland&#39;s second attempt at devolution will be just as dirty. THE FALLS - A student has gone missing in Edinburgh - completely out of character. There&#39;s almost nothing to go on but Detective Inspector John Rebus gets an unmistakable gut feeling that there&#39;s more to this than just another runaway high on unaccustomed freedom.

Co-incidentally, the meanings of all of their names were related to some colour or the other. The meanings of akamatsu and oumi were &#39;red pine&#39; and &#39;blue sea&#39; and the meanings of shirane and kurono were &#39;white root&#39; and &#39;black field&#39; respectively. Only tsukuru&#39;s name had no relation to colour. One fine day, all of a sudden, his friends made their decision clear to him that they don&#39;t want him in their group anymore. Tsukuru was totally taken aback and could not understand why they were doing this to him. Since then, he could never form a close bond with anyone who came into his life. Years later, his girlfriend, sara, suggested him to go and meet his friends and ask them the reason for abandoning him. Tsukuru then decided to dig out the truth. Find out if tsukuru is able to find out the true reason and mend his relation with his once best friends. Colorless tsukuru tazaki and his years of pilgrimage is a book with elements of intrigue, mystery and magic-realism. The book is published by random house in 2014 and comes with hardcover binding. Key features: it has the elements of alienation, humour and magical-realism that are unique to a murakami novel.</p><p>Haruki Murakami<b> </b>was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages. The most recent of his many international honors is the Jerusalem Prize, whose previous recipients include J. M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V. S. Naipaul. Translated by Philip Gabriel.From July of his sophomore year in college until the following January, all Tsukuru Tazaki could think about was dying. He turned twenty during this time, but this special watershed&#x2014;becoming an adult&#x2014;meant nothing. Taking his own life seemed the most natural solution, and even now he couldn&#x2019;t say why he hadn&#x2019;t taken this final step. Crossing that threshold between life and&nbsp;death would have been easier than swallowing down a slick, raw egg.<br><br> Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t commit suicide then because he couldn&#x2019;t conceive of a method that fit the pure and intense feelings he had toward death. But method was beside the point. If there had been a door within reach that led straight to death, he wouldn&#x2019;t have hesitated to push it open, without a second thought, as if it were just a part of ordinary life. For better or for worse, though, there was no such door nearby.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> I really should have died then, Tsukuru often told himself. Then this world, the one in the here and now, wouldn&#x2019;t exist. It was a captivating, bewitching thought. The present world wouldn&#x2019;t exist, and reality would no longer be real. As far as this world was concerned, he would simply no longer exist&#x2014;just as this world would no longer exist for him.<br><br> At the same time, Tsukuru couldn&#x2019;t fathom why he had reached this point, where he was teetering over the precipice. There was an actual event that had led him to this place&#x2014;this he knew all too well&#x2014;but why should death have such a hold over him, enveloping him in&nbsp;its embrace for nearly half a year? Envelop&#x2014;the word expressed it precisely. Like Jonah in the belly of the whale, Tsukuru had fallen into the bowels of death, one untold day after another, lost in a dark, stagnant void.<br><br>It was as if he were sleepwalking through life, as if&nbsp;he had already died but not yet noticed it. When the sun rose, so would Tsukuru&#x2014;he&#x2019;d brush his teeth, throw on whatever clothes were at hand, ride the train to college, and take notes in class. Like a person in a storm desperately grasping at a lamppost, he clung to this daily routine. He only spoke to people when necessary, and after school, he would return to his solitary apartment, sit on the floor, lean back against the wall, and ponder death and the failures of his life. Before him lay a huge, dark&nbsp;abyss that ran straight through to the earth&#x2019;s core. All he could see was a thick cloud of nothingness swirling around him; all he could hear was a profound silence squeezing his eardrums.<br><br>When he wasn&#x2019;t thinking about death, his mind was blank. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to keep from thinking. He didn&#x2019;t read any newspapers, didn&#x2019;t listen to music, and had&nbsp;no sexual desire to speak of. Events occurring in the outside world were, to him, inconsequential. When he grew tired of his room, he wandered aimlessly around the neighborhood or went to the station, where he sat on a bench and watched the trains arriving and departing, over and over again.<br><br> He took a shower every morning, shampooed his hair well, and did the laundry twice a week. Cleanliness was another one of his pillars: laundry, bathing, and teeth brushing. He barely noticed what he ate. He had lunch at the college cafeteria, but other than&nbsp;that, he hardly consumed a decent meal. When he felt hungry he stopped by the local supermarket and bought an apple or some vegetables. Sometimes he ate plain bread, washing it down with milk straight from the carton. &nbsp;When it was time to sleep, he&#x2019;d gulp down a glass of whiskey as if it were a dose of medicine. Luckily he wasn&#x2019;t much of a drinker, and a small dose of alcohol was all it took to send him off to sleep. He never&nbsp;dreamed. But even if he had dreamed, even if dreamlike images arose from the edges of his mind, they would have found nowhere to perch on the slippery slopes of his consciousness, instead quickly sliding off, down into the void.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The reason why death had such a hold on Tsukuru Tazaki was clear. One day his four closest friends, the friends he&#x2019;d known for a long time, announced that they did not want to see him, or talk with him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, with no room for compromise. They gave no explanation, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement. And Tsukuru didn&#x2019;t dare ask.<br><br> He&#x2019;d been friends with the four of them since high school, though when they cut him off, Tsukuru had already left his hometown and was attending college in Tokyo. So being banished didn&#x2019;t have any immediate negative effects on his daily routine&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like there would be awkward moments when he&#x2019;d run into them on the street. But that was just quibbling. The&nbsp;pain he felt was, if anything, more intense, and weighed down on him even more greatly because of the physical distance. Alienation and loneliness became a cable that stretched hundreds of miles long, pulled to the breaking&nbsp;point by a gigantic winch. And through that taut line, day and night, he received indecipherable messages. Like a gale blowing between trees, those messages varied in strength as they reached him in fragments, stinging his ears.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The five of them had been classmates at a public high school in the suburbs of Nagoya. Three boys, and two girls. During summer vacation of their freshman year, they all did some volunteer work together and became friends. Even after freshman year, when they were in different classes, they remained a close-knit group. The volunteer work that had brought them together had been part of a social studies summer assignment, but even after it ended, they chose to volunteer as a group.<br><br> Besides the volunteer work, they went hiking together on holidays, played tennis, swam at the Chita Peninsula, or got together at one of their houses to study for tests. Or else&#x2014;and this was what they did most often&#x2014;they just hung out someplace, and talked for hours.&nbsp; It wasn&#x2019;t like they showed up with a topic in mind&#x2014;they just never ran out of things to talk about.<br><br>Pure chance had brought them together. There were several volunteer opportunities they could have chosen from, but the one they all chose, independently, was&nbsp;an after-school tutoring program for elementary school kids (most of whom were children who refused to go to school). The program was run by a Catholic church, and of the thirty-five students in their high school class, the five of them were the only ones who selected it. To start, they participated in a three-day summer camp outside Nagoya, and got to be good friends with the children.<br><br> Whenever they took a break, the five of them gathered to talk. They got to know each other better, sharing their ideas and opening up about their dreams, as well as their problems. And when the summer camp was over, each one of them felt they were in the right place, where they needed to be, with the perfect companions. A unique sense of harmony developed between them&#x2014;each one needed the other four and, in turn, shared the sense that they too were needed. The whole convergence was like a lucky but entirely accidental chemical fusion, something that could only happen&nbsp;once. You might gather the same materials and make identical preparations, but you would never be able to duplicate the result.<br><br>After the initial volunteer period, they spent about two weekends a month at the after-school program, teaching the kids, reading to them, playing with them. They mowed the lawn, painted the building, and repaired playground equipment. They continued this&nbsp;work for the next two years, until they graduated from high school.<br><br>The only source of tension among them was the uneven number&#x2014;the fact that their group was comprised of three boys and two girls. If two of the boys and two of the girls became couples, the remaining boy would be left out. That possibility must have always been hanging over their heads like a small, thick, lenticular cloud. But it never happened, nor did it even seem a likely possibility.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps coincidentally, all five of them were from suburban, upper-middle-class families. Their parents were baby boomers; their fathers were all professionals. Their parents spared no expense when it came to their children&#x2019;s education. On the surface, at least, their families were peaceful, and stable. None of their parents got divorced, and most of them had stay-at-home mothers. Their high school emphasized academics, and their grades were uniformly good. Overall there were far more similarities than differences in their everyday environments.<br><br> And aside from Tsukuru Tazaki, they had another small, coincidental point in common: their last names all contained a color. The two boys&#x2019; last names were&nbsp;Akamatsu&#x2014;which means&nbsp; &#x201c;red pine&#x201d;&#x2014;and Oumi&#x2014;&#x201c;blue sea&#x201d;; the girls&#x2019; family names were Shirane&#x2014;&#x201c;white root&#x201d;&#x2014;and Kurono&#x2014;&#x201c;black field.&#x201d; Tazaki was the only last name that did not have a color in its meaning. From the very beginning this fact made him feel a little bit left out. Of course, whether or not you had a color as part of your name had nothing to do with your personality. Tsukuru understood this. But still, it disappointed him, and he surprised himself by feeling hurt. Soon,&nbsp;the other four friends began to use nicknames: the boys were called Aka (red) and Ao (blue); and the girls were Shiro (white) and Kuro (black). But he just remained Tsukuru. How great it would be, he often thought, if I had a color in my name too. Then everything would be perfect.<br><br> Aka was the one with the best grades. He never seemed to study hard, yet was at the top of his class in every subject. He never bragged about his grades, however, and preferred to cautiously stay in the background, almost as if he were embarrassed to be so smart. But&nbsp;as often is the case with short people&#x2014;he never grew past five foot three&#x2014;once he made up his mind about something, no matter how trivial it might be, he never backed down. And he was bothered by illogical rules and by teachers who couldn&#x2019;t meet his exacting standards. He hated to lose; whenever he lost a tennis match, it put him in a bad mood. He didn&#x2019;t act out, or&nbsp;pout&#x2014;instead, he just became unusually quiet. The other four friends found his short temper amusing and often teased him about it. Eventually Aka would always break down and laugh along with them. His father was a professor of economics at Nagoya University.<br><br>Ao was impressively built, with wide shoulders and a barrel chest, as well as a broad forehead, a generous mouth, and an imposing nose. He was a forward on the rugby team, and in his senior year he was elected team captain. He really hustled on the field and was constantly getting cuts and bruises. He wasn&#x2019;t good&nbsp;at buckling down and studying, but he was a cheerful person and enormously popular among his classmates. He always looked people straight in the eye, spoke in a clear, strong voice, and had an amazing appetite, seeming to enjoy everything set down in front of him. He also had a quick recall of people&#x2019;s names and faces, and seldom said anything bad about anyone else. He was&nbsp;a good listener and a born leader. Tsukuru could never forget the way he&#x2019;d gather his team around him before a match to give them a pep talk.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen up!&#x201d; Ao would bellow. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to win. The only question is how and by how much. Losing is not an option for us. You hear me? Losing is not an option!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not an option!&#x201d; the team would shout, before rushing out onto the field.<br><br>Not that their high school rugby team was all that&nbsp;good. Ao was clever and extremely athletic, but the team itself was mediocre. When they went up against teams from private schools, where players had been recruited from all over the country on athletic scholarships, Ao&#x2019;s team usually lost. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tell his friends, &#x201c;is the will to win. In the real world we can&#x2019;t always win. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And sometimes you get rained out,&#x201d; Kuro remarked, with typical sarcasm.<br><br>Ao shook his head sadly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re confusing rugby with baseball or tennis. Rugby&#x2019;s never postponed on account of rain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You play even when it&#x2019;s raining?&#x201d; Shiro asked, surprised. Shiro knew next to nothing about &nbsp;sports, and had zero interest in them.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Aka said seriously. &#x201c;Rugby matches are never canceled. No matter how hard it rains. That&#x2019;s why every year you get a lot of players who drown during matches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My God, that&#x2019;s awful!&#x201d; Shiro said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. He&#x2019;s joking,&#x201d; Kuro said, in a slightly disgusted tone.<br><br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Ao went on, &#x201c;my point is that if you&#x2019;re an athlete you have to learn how to be a good loser.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You certainly get a lot of practice with that every day,&#x201d; Kuro said.<br><br>Shiro was tall and slim, with a model&#x2019;s body and&nbsp;the graceful features of a traditional Japanese doll. Her long hair was a silky, lustrous black. Most people who passed her on the street would turn around for a second look, but she seemed to find her beauty embarrassing. She was a serious person, who above all else disliked drawing attention to herself. She was also a wonderful, skilled pianist, though she would never play for someone she didn&#x2019;t know. She seemed happiest while teaching piano to children in an after-school program. During these lessons, Shiro looked completely relaxed, more relaxed than Tsukuru saw her at any other&nbsp; time. Several of the children, Shiro said, might not be good at regular schoolwork, but they had a natural talent for music and it would be a shame to not develop it. The school only had an old upright piano, almost an antique, so the five of them started a fund-raising drive to buy a new one. They worked part-time during summer vacation, and persuaded a company that made musical instruments to help them out. In the spring of their senior year, their hard work finally paid off, resulting in the purchase of a grand piano for the school. Their campaign caught people&#x2019;s attention and was even featured in a newspaper.<br><br>Shiro was usually quiet, but she loved animals so&nbsp;much that when a conversation turned to dogs and cats, her face lit up and the words would cascade out from her. Her dream was to become a veterinarian, though Tsukuru couldn&#x2019;t picture her with a scalpel, slicing open the belly of a Labrador retriever, or sticking her hand&nbsp;up the anus of a horse. If she went to vet school, that&#x2019;s exactly the kind of training she&#x2019;d have to do. Her father ran an ob-gyn clinic in Nagoya.<br><br>Kuro wasn&#x2019;t beautiful, but she was eager and charming and always curious. She was large-boned and full-bodied, and already had a well-developed bust by the time she was sixteen. She was independent and tough, with a mind as quick as her tongue. She did well in humanities subjects, but was hopeless at math and physics. Her father ran an accounting firm in Nagoya, but there was no way she would ever be able to help out. Tsukuru often helped her with her math homework. She could be sarcastic but had a unique, refreshing sense of humor, and he found talking with her fun and stimulating. She was a great reader, too, and always had a book under her arm.<br><br> Shiro and Kuro had been in the same class in junior high and knew each other well, even before the five of them became friends.

So it's no wonder that this audiobook is a superb result of this partnership. The four characters from the Circle of Magic series, Sandry, Tris, Briar, and Daja, have lost their magical connection, and only through a diplomatic junket to the Empress Berinene's court do they reforge their friendship. At first, one questions the choice of Pierce to narrate since she has a slightly sibilant sound and speaks too slowly, but listeners soon realize that her pace differentiates dialogue from description. The young actors portraying the friends are well cast, and the empress is convincing as a charming yet controlling ruler.

Douglas has stood foursquare in the arena of American politics for many years, often alone, but intransigent. A strong and icorruptible public servant, he was embattled throughout the many years of his career as United States Senator from Illinois. Paul Douglas has been a great friend of the exploited -- whether underprivileged people or abused natural resources. His name has come to stand for insistent defense of civil rights, hostility to bureaucracy, advocation of the prevention of waste and generous aid to depressed areas, championing of ecological preservation and fierce opposition to all those who hoodwink the public, particularly in terms of lending. Senator Douglas waited to complete this book until his retirement from political life, because he was determined not to write a stuffy, pussyfooting &#34;official&#34; autobiography. He tells it the way he saw it -- about both the issues and the many prominent people who throng these pages. Trotsky, Stalin, Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Rayburn, Morse, Stevenson, the Kennedys -- all these and many more are drawn to the life in a fascinating, scrupulously honest book.

It is the world of consciousness, a protean mental landscape that each of us knows intimately in bits and pieces yet understands in its totality scarcely at all. Tied to the body and the brain, consciousness is nonetheless beyond our ability to measure or quantify. Despite the attempts of scientists and mystics, poets and dreamers, crackpots and geniuses, to map its contours and explain its secret workings, the mind remains mysterious. And the more we learn about it, the more mysterious it becomes.<br><br>But that is not to say that we know nothing about consciousness. In fact, as gonzo science journalist Jeff Warren demonstrates in this provocative, often hilarious, and always fascinating synthesis of cutting-edge research and personal experience, just how much we do know is little short of astonishing. And when Warren fits the pieces together, the implications of that knowledge are, well, mind-blowing. <br><br>Warren begins with the insight that consciousness is not a simple on-off proposition, with rigid demarcations separating waking awareness from the murky depths of sleep, but rather a round-the-clock continuum regulated by natural biorhythms. He then sets out to explore, and to experience for himself, the seemingly miraculous, all-but-untapped potential of the human mind.<br><br>From the full-immersion virtual realities of lucid dreaming to the esoteric disciplines of Eastern meditative practices that have reached outposts of consciousness far beyond the grasp of Western science, from techniques of hypnosis and neurofeedback to such exotic states of awareness as the Watch and the Pure Conscious Event, Warren takes us on an incredible journey through our own heads&#x2013;a journey conducted with the adventurous spirit and intellectual curiosity of a Darwin coupled with the sensibility of a stand-up comedian. <br><br>Part user&#x2019;s manual and part travel guide, <i>The Head Trip </i>is an instant classic, a brilliant summation of consciousness studies that is also a practical guide to enhancing creativity, mental health, and the experience of what it means to be human.

It was a difficult job. Every morning at 5 a.m. some classic rock anthem would blare out across the makeshift camp and we&#x2019;d drag ourselves from our warm tents and pile into the rusted yellow school buses idling on the logging road. Out on &#x201c;the block,&#x201d; we were assigned huge chunks of napalmed land, uneven mixes of charred duff, swamp, and scraggly brush. For eleven hours we&#x2019;d plant little �eight-�inch saplings&#x2013;�kick-�shovel-�draw-�bend-�insert-�stomp�kick-�shovel-�draw-�bend-�insert-�stomp&#x2013;�little mechanical humans jerking along the horizon.

It was still early, a little after 9 a.m. I had just loaded up my bags with trees and stood gazing out over the denuded expanse of earth and rubble. I sighed, looked down at my shovel, and began planting. When I raised my head I noticed the sun was on the other side of the sky. Little green spruce dotted the landscape all around me, and on the road empty tree containers sat in a disorderly pile. My watch said 2 p.m. Five hours had passed and I remembered nothing. What �happened?<br><br>I had no idea, but like other planters before me I welcomed the state. Now days alternated between �time-�crawling �now�ness, idle �daydreams&#x2013;�another important �consolation&#x2013;�and these strange absences, little wormholes in time where we dropped off the land and reappeared several hours �later.<br><br>One day I experienced a new variation. I mounted a steep ridge and there, towering before me, was an enormous white pine with silver scales and a broad, knotted trunk. The tree was wrapped in a gauzy halo of needles, and in the �late-�afternoon sun they filled with golden light. I caught my breath and everything went suddenly very still. The background chatter of the forest faded, and I had the feeling that time had paused, except, in contrast to my wormhole experiences, &#x201c;I&#x201d; remained to witness the ellipsis. But it was not an &#x201c;I&#x201d; I recognized. As strange as it may sound, I felt as if I were somehow part of the tree. I stood transfixed, a large, unblinking eyeball. And then the feeling passed. In front of me was just a tree. I looked down and continued �planting.1<br><br>The experience of tree planting didn&#x2019;t end at night. As soon as our eyes closed, a �slow-�moving landscape flickered up on our retinas and we watched reruns of the day&#x2013;�kick-�shovel-�draw-�bend-�insert-�stomp, �kick-�shovel-�draw-�bend-�insert-�stomp. I remember being struck by the photographic perfection of these images, bright visuals that were often accompanied by the physical sensation of movement, like that wobbly �sea-�legs feeling you get after a day of sailing. Once fully asleep, the activity seemed to rev up a notch. I dreamed of twisting in my sleep so I could plant my bedroll, or trying to slam my shovel through the asphalt of an endless dream highway. I often woke in the night protesting: it isn&#x2019;t fair, this isn&#x2019;t my workday, <i>this is my time off</i>. I shouldn&#x2019;t have to plant now! When I struggled against the dream narrative I inevitably woke myself up, though several times I flickered into momentary �self-�consciousness in the dream itself, and stood there in the empty expanse of dream land with my dream shovel in my hand thinking this was a really weird situation, I&#x2019;d have to remember to tell someone. Inevitably I woke exhausted, and on the bumpy ride out to the block, all of us muttered about our diabolically doubled �workloads.<br><br>Tree planting got me thinking about consciousness because the unvarying sameness of the days provided a perfect backdrop for alterations. I noticed the differences, and they seemed to correspond to shifts more fundamental than those of mood or even alertness. In the previous few paragraphs I&#x2019;ve described seven distinct states of consciousness that most of us have likely experienced at some time or another: general alertness, daydreaming, deep absorption, a heightened present, �sleep-�onset imagery, dreaming, and the very beginnings of a lucid dream. Some of these occur with strict regularity, others are more rare. And although a few of them may sound mystical, one of the main preoccupations of this book is how far science has come in shedding light on their �character.<br><br>Until that summer, my conception of consciousness was little more than a crude on/off switch in my head. We were awake, and then we were asleep. Sure, there were dreams, but these sort of happened off the record. Unless you wanted eye rolls and public derision, you only told your �bed-�partner about them (&#x201c;I opened the umbrella and out flopped a �half-�dozen pale cow �udders&#x2013;�can you believe that?&#x201d;). Clearly there was more to consciousness than these two �options&#x2013;�how many variations were there, �exactly?<br><br>The answer, of course, is �billions&#x2013;�as many variations as there are individuals to experience them, and within each individual a succession of seemingly unique moments. This disorienting plentitude seems all but impossible to quantify, for the one thing we can say with certainty about consciousness is that it is an ineffably private and subjective �affair.<br><br>Except that isn&#x2019;t the full story. Because underneath our shifting tides of awareness are �specific&#x2013;�and �regular&#x2013;�physiological changes occurring in the brain. The most elemental of these are the circadian processes that govern our �sleep-�wake cycle. These undulating rhythms form the basic contours of subjective consciousness; they guide changing levels of alertness through each day and, in concert with their chemical emissaries, move us through the various stages of sleep at �night.<br><br>The notion that sleep is not a single monolithic state is perhaps not fully appreciated by most people. We cycle through stages, of which �slow-�wave and rem sleep are the most distinct. Each of these two states is as different from the other as they are from waking. This is the case regarding: 1) their specific functions; 2) the physical processes that form them; and 3)&#x2013;crucially, for the purposes of this �book&#x2013;�what they <i>feel like</i> to experience. These three states of consciousness&#x2013;�slow-�wave sleep, rem sleep, and �waking&#x2013;�form the primary compass of human �experience.<br><br>This psychological and neuroscientific and experiential story of how consciousness changes over �twenty-�four hours is the first story I want to tell, and it forms the loose skeleton of this book. But there is a larger, more important story, one that involves some of consciousness&#x2019;s more dramatic variations, because overtop and between these three primary states, the mind is capable of visiting some very strange destinations. Since I can&#x2019;t reliably talk about the shifting experience of consciousness without �test-�driving some of those changes myself, I have gone on six adventures, six major head trips that ended up challenging everything I thought I knew about the expanse of consciousness and how our minds relate to our �brains.<br><br>The trips themselves were �far-�ranging in both a geographic and a psychological sense. From Montreal to Hawaii, London to New York, Scotland to northern Ontario, my body moved and my mind moved with it, propelled through the visionary logic of the hypnagogic, the mysterious �mid-�night awakening known as the Watch, that astonishing challenger to waking consciousness, the lucid dream, the plunging well of attention known as the trance, the sublimely alert �high-�resolution smr (captured on a computer&#x2019;s monitor), and the �quasi-�mystical substratum of awareness itself known as the Pure Conscious Event. Along the way I discovered other �states&#x2013;�some familiar, some less so: the parasomnias, the slow wave, the rem dream, the hypnopompic, the daydream, and the athlete&#x2019;s Zone. That these various states are not better �known&#x2013;�at least in the West2&#x2013;or more clearly understood has to do with the interrelated histories of the scientific study of consciousness in general and the study of sleep in �particular.<br><br>Things started well enough in the late nineteenth century, with psychologists like William James championing a new scientific field. &#x201c;A science of the relations of the mind and brain,&#x201d; wrote James, &#x201c;must show how the elementary ingredients of the former correspond to the elementary functions of the latter.&#x201d;<br><br>First-�person approaches to consciousness were deemed essential, and indeed they took off in philosophy under the banner of �phenomenology&#x2013;�the study of consciousness and its immediate �objects&#x2013;�and in psychology, in a school of thinking called introspection. Yet although introspectionist psychologists like Wilhelm Wundt and his student E. B. Titchener developed some interesting experimental methods for measuring the contents of the mind, the young discipline was heavily criticized by other psychologists: introspection wasn&#x2019;t scientific enough, �self-�reports of mental phenomena could not be trusted, even introspectionists themselves, the critics argued, could not agree on the facts. Looking back on the school now, part of the problem was an inability to access purely objective measurements of mental activity; the �brain-�imaging tools we possess today had not yet been �developed.<br><br>While phenomenology flapped around in continental European academic circles, introspection took a nosedive, and in its place rose the behaviorists. Forget about interiors, for these scientists what mattered were the externals: behavior. Behavior could be replicated and quantified. Ring a bell, a dog salivates; stimulus, response. Under the reign of the behaviorists, &#x201c;consciousness&#x201d; became a dirty word, an �airy-�fairy object of scorn with no place in the lab. Consciousness was left to the �humanities&#x2013;�to the writers and the philosophers. And without a scientific language to describe or even acknowledge the shifting experience of consciousness, it remained for New Age and religious traditions to �co-�opt some of its more dramatic manifestations (such as lucid dreaming and the various levels of meditative absorption). Which only served, of course, to further remove them from scientific �respectability.<br><br>One exception to this trend was a blip of activity in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, when the nascent science of &#x201c;altered states&#x201d; took off under psychedelic researchers like Charles Tart, Oscar Janiger, Stanislav Grof, Timothy Leary, and others. With their focus on mind-altering drugs, they were among the few investigators to consider seriously the significant fact that consciousness changes. In his landmark 1969 anthology <i>Altered States of Consciousness</i>, the psychologist Charles Tart defined an altered state of consciousness (ASC) as one in which an individual experiences a &#x201c;<i>qualitative</i> shift in his pattern of mental functioning [Tart&#x2019;s italics].&#x201d; That is, not just a quantitative shift of becoming, for example, more or less alert, but a sense in the individual that &#x201c;some quality or qualities of his mental processes are different.&#x201d; This definition, of course, didn&#x2019;t extend only to the effects of drugs; experiences like dreaming and meditation and hypnosis were examined alongside LSD and psilocybin trips.3<br><br>Today consciousness has been rehabilitated. Neuroscientists like Christof Koch write about the quest for the neural correlates of consciousness, and in forums like <i>The Journal of Consciousness Studies</i> psychologists and philosophers are once again debating the merits of &#x201c;first-person approaches to consciousness.&#x201d; To back up these arguments, a new generation of Buddhist monks are having their eegs scrutinized for signs of unusual activity. So, waking consciousness is hot&#x2013;but what of sleeping consciousness?<br>1 Years later, while reading Annie Dillard&#x2019;s <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i>, I was excited to find this passage: &#x201c;I saw the backyard cedar where the mourning doves roost charged and transfigured, each cell buzzing with flame. I stood on the grass with the lights in it, grass that was wholly fire, utterly focused and utterly dreamed. It was less like seeing than like being for the first time seen, knocked breathless by a powerful glance.&#x201d; It was, Dillard writes later, as if a great door had opened on the present, and the tree flickered with &#x201c;the steady, inward flames of eternity.&#x201d; Same sentiment, different tree. Dillard calls these moments &#x201c;innocence&#x201d;: &#x201c;the spirits&#x2019; unselfconscious state at any moment of pure devotion to any object . . . at once a receptiveness and total concentration.&#x201d; My friend Dawn, more prosaically, calls them &#x201c;Matrix moments,&#x201d; after the film&#x2019;s signature frozen-in-air martial arts scenes.<br><br>2 More than one observer has pointed out that in the West we don&#x2019;t appreciate the full spectrum of naturally occurring altered states because they are not part of our legislated lived experience, our &#x201c;consensus reality,&#x201d; as psychologist Charles Tart puts it. We have a very sophisticated understanding of some things&#x2013;the material universe, for example&#x2013;but we neglect others. In the case of consciousness, most of us are not taught to recognize the subtle variations, so we have no vocabulary to describe them. This is not the case in many Eastern cultures, particularly those that put a premium on introspection. Thus the Buddhists, for example, describe dozens of meditative states, each with its own specific and apparently reproducible phenomenology.<br><br>3 By Tart&#x2019;s criteria, extreme mood changes also qualify as ascs. This makes perfect sense to me; when you&#x2019;re furious or deeply depressed, you see the world in an entirely different way. That said, the emotional brain has been the subject of many excellent books. It is not the specific subject of this one.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Never Done</h2><p>Traces the history and development of housework, household technology, and the lifestyles of American housewives from the nineteenth century to the present</p><p><b>Susan Strasser</b> is the author of <i>Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash </i>and <i>Satisfaction Guaranteed: The Making of the American Mass Market.</i> Her articles have appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Nation</i>.

The new consumerism declared that things that cost money had more value than those that did not; it even defined the time of year as tasks like spring housecleaning and laying in the wood for winter once did.

Eisenhower. But beyond telling the tale of this momentous event, Lars Anderson also reveals the broader social and historical context of the match, lending it his unique perspectives on sports and culture at the dawn of the twentieth century.<br><br>This story begins with the infamous massacre of the Sioux at Wounded Knee, in 1890, then moves to rural Pennsylvania and the Carlisle Indian School, an institution designed to &#x201c;elevate&#x201d; Indians by uprooting their youths and immersing them in the white man&#x2019;s ways. Foremost among those ways was the burgeoning sport of football. In 1903 came the man who would mold the Carlisle Indians into a juggernaut: Glenn &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; Warner, the son of a former Union Army captain. Guided by Warner, a tireless innovator and skilled manager, the Carlisle eleven barnstormed the country, using superior team speed, disciplined play, and tactical mastery to humiliate such traditional powerhouses as Harvard, Yale, Michigan, and Wisconsin&#x2013;and to, along the way, lay waste American prejudices against Indians. When a troubled young Sac and Fox Indian from Oklahoma named Jim Thorpe arrived at Carlisle, Warner sensed that he was in the presence of greatness. While still in his teens, Thorpe dazzled his opponents and gained fans across the nation. In 1912 the coach and the Carlisle team could feel the national championship within their grasp.<br><br>Among the obstacles in Carlisle&#x2019;s path to dominance were the Cadets of Army, led by a hardnosed Kansan back named Dwight Eisenhower. In Thorpe, Eisenhower saw a legitimate target; knocking the Carlisle great out of the game would bring glory both to the Cadets and to Eisenhower. The symbolism of this matchup was lost on neither Carlisle&#x2019;s footballers nor on Indians across the country who followed their exploits. Less than a quarter century after Wounded Knee, the Indians would confront, on the playing field, an emblem of the very institution that had slaughtered their ancestors on the field of battle and, in defeating them, possibly regain a measure of lost honor.<br><br>Filled with colorful period detail and fascinating insights into American history and popular culture, <i>Carlisle vs. Army</i> gives a thrilling, authoritative account of the events of an epic afternoon whose reverberations would be felt for generations.<br><br><i>"Carlisle vs. Army</i> is about football the way that <i>The Natural </i>is about baseball.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Jeremy Schaap, author of<i> I</i></p><p>Lars Anderson is a <i>Sports Illustrated</i> staff writer and a graduate of Columbia&#x2019;s Graduate School of Journalism.

He lives with his wife in Birmingham, Alabama.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>1<br><br>THE THRILL OF POSSIBILITY<br><br>The hand-rolled cigarette dangled from his lips, and a string of smoke drifted up around his brown eyes as he nervously paced through the locker room at West Point. Dressed in a bowler hat and dark gray suit, Glenn &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; Warner was buried deep in his own thoughts. Out on Army&#x2019;s football field five thousand fans filled the wooden bleachers and hundreds of others sat in folding chairs along the sidelines. Warner could hear the crowd murmur with expectation as he took another drag from his usual pregame cigarette, releasing more smoke from the orange glow of the burning tip. Time was running out before kickoff, and he was still searching for just the right words to spark a fire in the hearts of his Carlisle Indian School football players.<br><br>He moved between the benches in the small, musty locker room, striding past his players as they pulled on their red jerseys with the letter C emblazoned on the front, tightened the laces on their black cleats, and strapped on their leather helmets. The forty-two- year-old coach, with his bushy dark hair and barrel chest, had been daydreaming for months of this moment: the game against Army. On this autumn afternoon in 1912 he planned to unveil his latest offensive creation&#x2014;the double wing&#x2014;for the first time. The Indians had been practicing the complicated formation since the middle of the summer, and Warner hoped it would confuse the bigger, brawnier, stronger Cadets.<br><br>It was late in the season and, for Carlisle, the national championship was tantalizingly close: If the Indians beat Army, just three opponents stood between them and an undefeated season. Warner looked around at his twenty-two boys. They ranged in age from eighteen to twenty-four. Most of them had close-cropped dark hair, copper skin, and coffee-colored eyes, and were as thin as blades of prairie grass. They had come from reservations that dotted the plains of Middle America and as far west as Arizona to attend the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, a boarding school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for Indian boys and girls.<br><br>At Carlisle, the Indians were assimilated into white culture and forced to abandon every last trace of their heritage. The white teachers cut the Indians&#x2019; shiny black hair that reached down to their shoulders. They took their clothing, which was made from animal hides, and handed the boys blue military uniforms and the girls Victorian dresses. From the moment they first rode through the school gate in a horse-drawn covered wagon, the kids were not allowed to speak in their native languages. It would be English only from this point on.<br><br>The football team at Carlisle played all the powerhouses of the day&#x2014; Harvard, Yale, Princeton&#x2014;and now, on November 9, 1912, at West Point, Warner narrowed his eyes into a liquid gleam of intensity and began to speak in his gravelly voice, hoping to prepare his boys for a battle with another of those top-ranked teams. With the fervor of a tent-revival preacher, the coach told his players that this was the time and the place for the Indians to finally prove that they could play the white man&#x2019;s game better than the white man himself could. In graphic language, he explained that this was a chance to exact revenge for all the cold-blooded horrors that the white man had inflicted on their people in the past. It was the ancestors of these Army boys, Warner forcefully stated, who had killed and raped the ancestors of the Carlisle players.<br><br>On every play I want all of you to remember one thing. Remember that it was the fathers and grandfathers of these Army players who fought your fathers and grandfathers in the Indian Wars. Remember it was their fathers and grandfathers who killed your fathers and grandfathers. Remember it was their fathers and grandfathers who destroyed your way of life. Remember Wounded Knee. Remember all of this on every play. Let&#x2019;s go!<br><br>Nothing could cause the emotional temperature of the Indians to rise like the mention of the massacre at Wounded Knee, and after Warner&#x2019;s speech was over the players stormed out of the locker room and into the cool November air, filled with primal rage. Outside, the maples, elms, and oak trees that towered throughout the sixteen-thousand-acre West Point campus were tinted red and gold&#x2014;the colors of the northeastern autumn&#x2014;and a breeze strummed the branches. Above the Indians as they jogged onto Cullum Field, the cold sky was heavy with an underbelly of clouds that threatened to flood the ground with sleet. It was the kind of football weather that Warner loved: raw and foreboding, perfect for the most important game of his career.<br><br>Located forty-five miles north of New York City, the field at West Point was laid out on the granite cliffs high above the Hudson River. Hundreds of feet below the grassy field, scores of boats that had ferried fans from Manhattan and other ports along the Hudson were docked on the rocky shoreline. Late-arriving fans streamed out of the tiny West Point train depot. Once they stepped off the coal-driven locomotive, they climbed the steep hill that led to the broad green plain of the United States Military Academy, anxious to see the battle between Carlisle, the most famous underdogs of the early twentieth century, and the Cadets of Army.<br><br>While the Carlisle players warmed up, halfback Jim Thorpe loped around the field in his easy, graceful gait. Every movement he made to prepare for the game looked effortless. He kicked forty-yard field goals that cleaved the uprights, he flung beautiful passes that spiraled sixty yards through the air, he sprinted up the field with the ball in his hands and faked out imaginary defenders with feet as light as a ballroom dancer&#x2019;s. The twenty-four-year-old Thorpe had participated in the decathlon and pentathlon at the Fifth Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden, just four months earlier, and had generated more newspaper stories than any other athlete in the summer and fall of 1912&#x2014;more than Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, Shoeless Joe Jackson of the Chicago White Sox, or the Kentucky Derby winner, Worth. At this moment Thorpe was operating at the height of his athletic powers, and a stadium full of onlookers followed his every step, his every kick, his every snap of the wrist.<br><br>On the other side of the field a twenty-one-year-old Cadet player with blond hair and penetrating, icy blue eyes loosened up. Jogging in his gold leather helmet, black jersey, gold knickers, white socks, and black cleats, Dwight David Eisenhower didn&#x2019;t look intimidating&#x2014;he stood five feet, ten inches and weighed 180 pounds&#x2014;and he wasn&#x2019;t as fast as Thorpe nor as muscular. But Eisenhower possessed something that Army coach Ernest Graves couldn&#x2019;t teach: determination as strong as the gray granite of the Cadet barracks. Ike charged around the field like no one else on Graves&#x2019;s roster, and though he was only in his first year as a starter, Eisenhower had already established himself as Army&#x2019;s hardest hitter and toughest runner. Like every other player warming up on the field, Eisenhower played full-time on both sides of the ball&#x2014;halfback on offense, linebacker on defense. Now, as he stretched and prepared for the game, his mind was focused on two things: stampeding over Thorpe and the other Carlisle defenders when he had the ball in his hands on offense, and punishing Thorpe with vicious hits on defense.<br><br>Ever since Eisenhower and his Cadet teammates found out that Carlisle and Jim Thorpe would be coming to West Point, a day rarely passed at the Academy when the Army players didn&#x2019;t talk about how they were going to &#x201c;stop Thorpe.&#x201d; A Cadet would become famous, the Army players believed, if he knocked Thorpe out of the game with a hit so powerful it kidnapped Thorpe from consciousness. Eisenhower especially had been looking forward to this game for months. Finally, he would come head-to-head with the great Jim Thorpe on the football field.<br><br>As Eisenhower continued to warm up on this chilly afternoon, he had nearly as many eyes locked on him as Thorpe did. Ike, as his friends called him, had been prominently featured in The New York Times a few weeks earlier. The paper ran a two-column photo of Eisenhower and called him &#x201c;one of the most promising backs in Eastern football.&#x201d; Ike was a bruising inside runner who had a knack for dragging tacklers along with him for five, ten, even fifteen yards. And on defense, from his linebacker position, the rough kid from Abilene, Kansas, fully expected to be the chosen one&#x2014;the player who was going to deliver the knockout blow that would send Thorpe out of the game and into a hospital bed.<br><br>Minutes before kickoff, the bleachers on each side of Cullum Field were full. A cluster of sportswriters from New York City stood on the sidelines with pencils and notebooks in their hands. Walter Camp, the former Yale player and coach known as the &#x201c;Father of American Football,&#x201d; also was on the sideline. Wearing an overcoat and top hat, Camp wondered the same thing that every other fan did: Could Thorpe and the Carlisle Indians keep their national title hopes alive by beating Army, a team that Camp ranked as one of the best in the East?<br><br>Just then, the field shook and the air rumbled: A cannon on the north end of the field had fired a thunderous salute to the crowd. The fans erupted in applause. The team captains&#x2014;Thorpe for Carlisle, Leland Devore for Army&#x2014;met at midfield and shook hands. The coin spiked upward&#x2014;Thorpe won the flip and elected to defend the north goal. Devore told the referee that Army would kick off. Thorpe walked back to the sideline, where Warner gave his players a few last-second instructions and then ordered them onto the field. Thorpe was the team&#x2019;s deep return man, and he cantered onto the field with the cool of a confident thoroughbred approaching the starting gate. With a bitter wind feathering his cheeks, Thorpe buckled his helmet strap tightly...</p><h2>Breathing Under Water: Spirituality and the Twelve Steps</h2><p>Light wear to cover. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>FR RICHARD ROHR is a Franciscan priest of the New Mexico Province. He founded the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1986, where he presently serves as Founding Director. An internationally known speaker, he teaches on such themes as adult Christian spirituality, men&#39;s spirituality, and politics and spirituality, and has published many books, including Falling Upward and Immortal Diamond (SPCK, 2012 and 2013 respectively).Some presentations on Twelve-Step Programs attempt to present the spiritual underpinnings in universal terms without regard to any particular denomination or tradition. However, Rohr wraps the Twelve Steps in the cloak of Christianity and talks about the role the Gospel can play in addressing a society that he sees as deteriorating from social addictions, as well as individual ones. Rohr speaks with fervor about the politics and myths of our culture that condemn those who differ from us and that have convinced many Americans that the United States stands above all others. Rohr's passion for turning back to what he sees as the basic teachings of Jesus is strong.

Fourth novel in the series, following &#34;To Your Scattered Bodies Go,&#34; &#34;The Fabulous Riverboat,&#34; and &#34;The Dark Design.&#34;</p><p>At the end of <i>The Fabulous Riverboat</i>, Sam Clemens finally set out in the great iron riverboat <i>Not for Hire</i> to reach the headwaters of the massive river on whose shores humanity has been resurrected. After 33 years on the river, Clemens and his crew--including the giant subhuman Joe Miller--are finally near the end of their journey, and only one obstacle remains: the evil Earthly king, John Lackland. John is waiting just upriver in the <i>Rex Grandissimus</i>, the first riverboat that Sam constructed and the one that John and his crew hijacked, and he's hell-bent on sinking Sam's boat (and vice versa). Complicating the battle is the fact that both ships likely contain agents of the Ethicals, the group of advanced beings who created Riverworld for reasons unknown. One or more of the Ethicals themselves may even be on board, as are various humans that the rebel Ethical, known as the Mysterious Stranger (but known to Clemens simply as X), enlisted in his cause, which may or may not lead to humanity's salvation.<p> The battle is set to take place along the shores populated by members of the Church of the Second Chance, a group that believes they must attain ethical perfection in order to proceed to the next phase of existence. The Second Chancers are not violent, but their charismatic leader, La Viro, may attempt to sink one or both of the iron ships in order to prevent the battle. Among the Second Chancers is former Nazi officer Hermann Goring, who had a run-in with Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, <i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i>. Burton and his companions--among them several people who were contacted by the Mysterious Stranger--are reluctantly serving on John's boat in order to reach the headwaters of the river. But will any of the humans working for X survive the coming battle? And if so, how can they possibly hope to penetrate the tower in the North Sea where the Ethicals are thought to reside? And what could lowly humans hope to do against a race so advanced that they can reshape entire planets and resurrect all of humanity? <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>The answers behind the enigmatic origins of Riverworld lie at last within reach, as the remarkable gathering of Earthlings--including Sir Richard Francis Burton, Samuel Clemens, Alice Liddell Hargreaves (the real-life Alice in Wonderland), Cyrano de Bergerac, Ulysses S. Grant, and Baron Von Richtoven--finally breaches the stronghold of Riverworld's extraordinary super-race.<br><br>But answers would lead to more enigmatic questions . . . <br><br>Who is the Mysterious Stranger who taunted the Riverworld resurrectees with hints of the truth? What is the key to the gargantuan computer that wields the power of life and death? The astonishing secrets lie within the Dark Tower--but only for those brave enough to seek them and wise enough to decipher them . . .</p><h2>Men In The Bible: The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly</h2><p>MEN IN THE BIBLE explores the lives of twelve men whose lives figure prominently in Scripture--six each from the Old and New Testaments. Throughout the text, John O&#39;Grady is careful to keep these stories in perspective and focuses on the historical and archaeological evidence surrounding them. The profiles presented here represent the entire span of biblical history from Adam and Abraham to Jesus and his followers. Among them are such familiar figures as Moses, David, Jeremiah, Jesus, John the Baptist, Peter, and Judas. Apart from Jesus, all the subjects in this book have flaws--some of them quite serious. Often their noble qualities are obscured by such negative traits as pettiness, meanness, jealousy, anger, and pride. These bad and ugly aspects make the rough edges more than evident. Yet, these same individuals are bound together by a common faith in God. Even Judas must have had considerable talents and generosity to be included among the twelve disciples. As in biblical times, people today also represent a spectrum of traits, some good, some bad, and some downright ugly. But the author demonstrates that, because of the goodness of God, the bad and the ugly never eradicate the presence of goodness. He explains how such stories from the past can serve as examples for people today. By fully understanding the character of each of the men covered in this work, we can overcome the dark side of our natures and learn to become stronger and better people.</p><p>John F. O&#39;Grady is a priest of the Diocese of Albany New York and professor of biblical theology at Barry University in Miami. He is the author of seventeen books and numerous articles. Fr. O&#39;Grady has taught in seminaries and universities both in the U.S. and in Europe.</p><h2>Our Peaceable Kingdom: The Photographs of John Drysdale</h2><p>John Drysdale's photographs are exciting, tender, hilarious, often exhilarating- but for more than the obvious reasons. Certainly it's not every day that one sees a lion that's befriended a Boston terrier. Maybe elephants don't usually go fishing, and parrots generally don't tend to lounge around in beach chairs, next to their human companions. But in the "peaceable kingdom" of John Drysdale, surprisingly unique alliances flourish. His photographs are whimsical and charming, but also carry a very important, necessary truth - the essential bonds of friendship transcend appearances, expectations, and traditions. Cats can love mice, bulldogs can rear squirrels, and foxes can protect chicks.<br><br>With a refreshingly honest eye, Drysdale has captured the many ways in which the creatures that inhabit the earth bring one another comfort and happiness. Never mind that a burro and a boy are curled up on the sofa, or that a chimpanzee is sunbathing with his human family by the pool. Friendship is where you find it. The familiarity and love expressed in Drysdale's work is heartfelt and very real - as the endnotes explain, the exotic animals that are his subjects were often orphaned as babies, and reared along with the humans and other animals in the photographs.<br><br>Since his earliest photographs of children frolicking on the cobblestoned streets of London, Drysdale's wonderfully illustrious career has spanned close to fifty years. And in Our Peaceable Kingdom, for the first time, 100 of his most memorable images are collected in one beautiful volume, destined to become a favorite on the shelves of children, adults, animal lovers, and anyone who appreciates a good friend.<br></p><p>John Drysdale was born in Uganda, and learned photography at an early age. He spent the majority of his life in England, where he currently resides. His first assignments after studying photography at the Guilford College of Art were with Norman Parkinson at Vogue Studios and with Cecil Beaton, including a stint as royal court photographer for the Queen's coronation. He is best known for his photographs of unusual interspecies bonding and of children, which have received worldwide recognition in the form of postcards and calendars. His publishing credits and exhibitions are extensive. His awards include prizes from the British Press Pictures of the Year and from World Press Photo.<br><br>Margaret Regan, who has mingled careers in physical medicine and the arts, is a worldwide advocate of John Drysdale's photographs. She lives in New England.<br>"Animals are a part of all our lives, whether it be a pet dog or cat, or an exotic creature... John Drysdale's camera has caught some extremely unique moments on film -- the likes you've probably never seen before!" -- <i>Jack Hanna, host of "Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures" and</i></p><h2>Milkman: WINNER OF THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2018</h2><p><p><b><i>WINNER OF THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2018</i></b><br><i></i><br><i>'Milkman </i>is extraordinary.

Tracing the lives of Taos Ski Valley founder Ernie Blake and his early skiing friends, this book goes beyond biography to tell the origins of the downhill sport in the West. Assembling interviews with some of the greatest names in skiing, Rick Richards describes the making or Ernie Blake, the man who envisioned a world-class resort in Taos Ski Valley. He follows Ernie from Europe to New Mexico, recounting events that shaped Blake&#39;s life and changed American skiing. From the first runs at Sun Valley to the steeps of Taos today, Richards recreates the pioneering journeys of the first, innovative skiers in the nation.

In all, there are 58 titles in the original Hardy Boys Mysteries series published between 1927 and 1979 written by 17 different men and women.

Veblen's <b>The Theory of the Leisure Class</b> is in the tradition of Adam Smith's <b>The Wealth of Nations</b> and Thomas Hobbes's <b>Leviathan</b>, yet it provides a surprisingly contemporary look at American economics and society. Establishing such terms as "conspicuous consumption" and "pecuniary emulation," Veblen's most famous work has become an archetype not only of economic theory, but of historical and sociological thought as well. As sociologist Alan Wolfe writes in his Introduction, Veblen "skillfully . . . wrote a book that will be read so long as the rich are different from the rest of us; which, if the future is anything like the past, they always will be."<b>Thorstein Veblen</b> (1857-1929) was a Norwegian-American sociologist and economist and a leader of the Efficiency Movement.

From a case of rape by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa to our role in Asia's financial crisis, from our early support for Saddam Hussein to our actions in the Balkans, Johnson reveals the ways in which our misguided policies are planting the seeds of future disaster.<br><br>In the wake of the Cold War, the United States has imprudently expanded the commitments it made over the previous forty years, argues Johnson. In Blowback, he issues a warning we would do well to consider: it is time for our empire to demobilize before our bills come due.<br></p><p>If the 20th century was the American century, the 21st century may be a time of reckoning for the United States. Chalmers Johnson, an authority on Japan and its economy, offers a troubling prognosis of what's to come. <i>Blowback</i>--the title refers to a CIA neologism describing the unintended consequences of American activity--is a call for the United States to rethink its position in the world. "The evidence is building up that in the decade following the end of the Cold War, the United States largely abandoned a reliance on diplomacy, economic aid, international law, and multilateral institutions in carrying out its foreign policies and resorted much of the time to bluster, military force, and financial manipulation," writes Johnson. "The world is not a safer place as a result." Individual chapters focus on Okinawa (where American servicemen were accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in "Asia's last colony"), the two Koreas, China, and Japan. The result is a liberal-leaning (and Asia-centric) call for the United States to disengage from many of its global commitments. Critics will call Johnson an isolationist, but friends (perhaps admirers of Patrick Buchanan's <i>A Republic, Not an Empire</i>) will say he simply speaks good sense. All will agree he is an earnest voice: "I believe our very hubris ensures our undoing." <i>--John J.

The single mother of five believed she could weather any storm, that she could keep her family from harm with fortitude and grace.

This is her first book.When her 22-year-old son Ned was seriously injured in a 2005 car accident, Rogers's well-organized life changed forever. Ned suffered spinal cord injury, major brain trauma, and organ damage, and doctors didn't expect him to live. Rogers refuses to give up, her stubborn resolve eventually turning into hope upon learning of Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled. Ned is put on the waiting list for a year, and regains his ability to speak and eat solid food, though severe nerve pain hampers his recovery. Finally he meets Kasey, a capuchin monkey. Rogers's younger daughters see Kasey as a pet, and Rogers envisions "an elaborate Golden Monkey Myth" in which Kasey answers all their prayers. When Kasey moves in for "Monkey Boot Camp," he proves a lively newcomer, upsetting the delicate hierarchy of the home, and Rogers learns more about the proper care, feeding, and bathing of monkeys than she ever imagined. Ned builds a bond with Kasey, the monkey slowly helping him to regain confidence and some physical abilities. Although Rogers's pace slows in spots and she doesn't always avoid clich�, her story is engaging and poignant. (Nov.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Conversations with Will Self, Jon Savage, Iain Sinclair and John Gray, and collaborators like David Cronenberg, are a reminder of his wit and humanity, testament to Ballard&#x2019;s profound worldliness as much as his otherworldly imagination.

His 1984 bestseller Empire of the Sun won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It was later filmed by Steven Spielberg.

Bob Rotella, sports psychologist and author of <i>Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect</i> and <i>Golf Is a Game of Confidence</i>, knows what the problem is: commitment. Once a player commits himself to doing better, and does what it takes to achieve that goal, he or she will improve. Rotella's plan for making and following through on that commitment is an excellent one. He says very clearly, and right at the beginning of the book, that his plan isn't for someone who plays golf once a month for pleasure. This is for hard-core dimpleheads, male or female, and it's a serious, extremely workable program.World-renowned performance consultant and sports psychologist Dr. Bob Rotella has written The Golf of Your Dreams for the golfer who is determined to get better but hasn&#39;t figured out how to go about it. Building on his success with golfers, Dr. Rotella now teaches and details a plan for lowering your handicap, ensuring your improvement if you follow his plan. His program for success in playing the golf of your dreams is based on strategies found to be successful with tour players such as Tom Kite, Brad Faxon, Pat Bradley, and Davis Love III, and is similar to approaches used by Rotella&#39;s other clients who are top athletes in a variety of different sports. In The Golf of Your Dreams Dr. Rotella provides tips on how to choose the right teaching professional, communicate your dreams and goals to your teacher, get your teacher to teach you as a student serious about improving, make a plan for improvement with your teacher and stay committed, sustain and honor your commitment, break old habits and develop new ones, and practice efficiently and effectively so you can take your learning from the practice area to the golf course.</p><h2>From Image to Likeness: A Jungian Path in the Gospel Journey</h2><p>A presentation of the Gospel as illuminated through the Jungian personality types.</p><p>This book represents a stage on a journey.

Although the writing took 10 years, sure it reads as if it were no trouble at all, at all for the author. As have many of her fellow native Irish storytellers, she finds inspiration in the island's legendary heroes. But her uproariously funny, scarely, suspenseful fairy tale is entirely original. The enchantment begins at once as two evil spirits fly to Galway to await The Morrigan, Great Queen: "All the time invisible; except once, when they swooped down on a basking shark and frightened it silly. . . All the time silent; except when they tapped their teeth with their finger-nails and sent lightning. . . ." In the city, the spirits become two strange women on a motorbike, followed by their hounds. "All this because a boy was about to buy a book in the second-hand bookshop, in the small grey city." The boy is Patrick Joseph (Pidge), urged by something he doesn't understand to own the ancient, tattered pages; it looks very boring. But he takes "A Book of Patrick's Writing" home and it throws him, as well as his five-year-old sister Brigit, into the war on the side of noble Cuchulain against wicked Morrigan. Moving into the house near to the children, the demonic females fail again and again to steal the miraculous volume. Pidge and Brigit escape by a hair's breadth from each deadly trapat times saved by fairies in the guise of tinkers, frequently by the mischief created by silver-tongued Brigit, a genius at telling lies that frustrate the foe. All the while, Cuchulain's valiant army and The Morrigan's forces are rushing to a decisive battle. In an astonishing finale, O'Shea describes a lyrical moment when Pidge and Brigit try to remember who has left gifts for them . . . and why. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Victim Six (A Waterman &amp; Stark Thriller)</h2><p><b>"Wickedly clever!

Lee Schneller, who has designed and built more than 150 gardens in Maine since 1995, takes you through the five steps to continuous color, including grabbing graph paper and a pen and checking out the plant palette and flower catalog in the back of the book. I particularly liked the flower catalog, which lists more than 200 trusty perennials selected for, among other things, their hardiness, attractive flowers and foliage, and long bloom time. The flower catalog provides the bloom period of each in a useful, graphical way. My only wish is that Schneller would publish a follow-up flower catalog for those who want more."&nbsp; -Ann Robinson, <i>oregonlive.com</i> 05/06/09<br><br>"If you, like me, love color in the garden, both for admiring and cutting, you'll pick up <i>The Ever-Blooming Flower Garden</i>.

He was fit and strong. He had a good guidebook and all the right equipment. His pilgrim passport would grant him access to the shelter of hostels along the way. But all that, however helpful, did not begin to encompass the grandeur of his external or internal adventure. A Million Steps climbs over the high meadows of the Pyrenees, quests through the unceasing wind of the Meseta, and dances in the rains of Galicia. While following the yellow arrows that mark the route, Koontz also navigates through his personal history of addiction, recovery, and love. With outgoing humor and friendliness, he embraces the beauty of the countryside and joyful connections to other pilgrims from around the world. Part diary, part travelogue, A Million Steps is a journey within a journey all the way to the Cathedral de Santiago de Compostela and beyond.</p><p>Kurt Koontz was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. &nbsp;At the age of 36, he retired from a sales executive career at a Fortune 500 company. &nbsp;For the past decade, his travels have taken him to all corners of the world. &nbsp;These adventures are off the beaten path and usually involve physical and mental endurance. In September of 2012, he walked 500 miles on the Camino de Santiago in Spain. The journey was a life changing experience and he decided to write his first book to share the experience.</p><h2>DKfindout!

A wedding in Toura, a suicide bombing in Jerusalem, uneasy interactions between Arab and Jewish neighbors in University Heights, the expulsion of Palestinians in Jaffa, another bombing in Gaza: Shrapnel Maps traces the hurt and tender places, where political noise turns into the voices of Palestinians and Israelis. Working with documentary flyers, vintage postcards, travelogues, cartographic language, and first person testimonies, Shrapnel Maps ranges from monologue sonnets to prose vignettes, polyphonics to blackouts, indices to simultaneities, as Palestinians and Israelis long for justice and peace, for understanding and survival.</p><p>Philip Metres is the author and translator of eleven books and chapbooks, including The Sound of Listening: Poetry as Refuge and Resistance (University of Michigan 2018); Pictures at an Exhibition (University of Akron 2016);; Sand Opera (Alice James 2015); and I Burned at the Feast: Selected Poems of Arseny Tarkovsky (Cleveland State Poetry Center, 2015).

I want to say, it&#x2019;s not me, slide out of view behind a wall of cupboards, ominous breakfast table, steam of tea, our two young daughters now alone. I want no trouble. Must I fight for my wife&#x2019;s desire for yellow blooms when my neighbors&#x2019; tomatoes will stunt and blight in shade?

Set in San Francisco, this is the story of Martin Eden, an impoverished seaman who pursues, obsessively and aggressively, dreams of education and literary fame. London, dissatisfied with the rewards of his own success, intended <i>Martin Eden </i>as an attack on individualism and a criticism of ambition; however, much of its status as a classic has been conferred by admirers of its ambitious protagonist. Andrew Sinclair's wide-ranging introduction discusses the conflict between London's support of socialism and his powerful self-will. Sinclair also explores the parallels and divergences between the life of Martin Eden and that of his creator, focusing on London's mental depressions and how they affected his depiction of Eden.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Personifying London's own dreams of education and literary fame as a young man in San Francisco, Martin Eden's impassioned but ultimately ineffective battle to overcome his bleak circumstances makes him one of the most memorable and poignant characters Jack London ever created. As Paul Berman points out in his Introduction, "In Martin, [London] created one of the great twisted heroes of American literature . . . a hero doomed from the outset because his own passions are bigger and more complicated than any man could bear."</p><h2>Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman</h2><p><b>Batman's biggest secret is not Bruce Wayne.</b><br><br>Every Batman story is marked with the words "Batman created by Bob Kane." But that isn't the whole truth. A struggling writer named Bill Finger was involved from the beginning. Bill helped invent Batman, from concept to costume to character.

He proposed colors that could better fade into the shadows.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He recommended replacing the wisp of a mask with a cowl that covered all but Bat-Man&#x2019;s chin.

Superman was alien-born and near-invulnerable. Bill thought that Bat-Man should be a human being who could be hurt. A superhero without superpowers.

They came in small family groups and survived unimaginably cold winters and animals such as the giant beaver and cave bear. Fortunately, they had their great god, Gluskape, who slowly melted the ice and rid the woods of terrifying serpents. But he was also a liar and a big tease! It was a time when people, animals, and stones were equal; when Gluskape could be as large as a mountain or as small as a mouse, when the Star People traveled to the treetops. Slowly, things started to change. The tribes squabbled and Gluskape hated jealousy. It was m&#39;teouin that people and animals needed-inner strength. The stories instruct people in the ways of hunting, the lore of plants, and the skills they needed every day. There is still much for us to learn about Maine as the next great climate change approaches. Will we hurt the land with our jealousy and greed? Or will we learn to be alone and appreciate the magic of every stone? The Native storytellers who still remembered these tales 12 centuries later included Tomah Joseph, Marie Saksis, Louis Mitchell, and Noel Neptune. By then, few Wabanakis remained and efforts began to preserve the language and write down fragments, mostly from the Fundy area in Nova Scotia.</p><p>Alice Mead is the author of 18 novels, aimed at awakening awareness and appreciation of the culture of our neighbors, from Native American tribes to Kurdish teens in Iran.

But what gave the eventual victor of these brutal and complex wars, Henry Tudor, the right to claim the crown? What made his Beaufort mother the great heiress of medieval England, and how exactly did an illegitimate line come to challenge the English monarchy? This book uncovers the rise of the Beauforts from bastard stock of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, to esteemed companions of their cousin Henry V, celebrated victor of Agincourt, and tracks their fall with the House of Lancaster during the 1460s and 1470s. The hopes and fortunes of the family gradually came to rest upon the shoulders of a teenage widow named Margaret Beaufort and her son Henry.

Specifically, it explains how this notion surfaced amid socio-religious tensions in early modern Spain, and was initially used against Jewish and Muslim converts to Christianity. It was then transplanted to the Americas, adapted to colonial conditions, and employed to create and reproduce identity categories according to descent. Mart�nez also examines how the state, church, Inquisition, and other institutions in colonial Mexico used the notion of purity of blood over time, arguing that the concept's enduring religious, genealogical, and gendered meanings and the archival practices it promoted came to shape the region's patriotic and racial ideologies.</p><p>Mar�a Elena Mart�nez is Associate Professor of History and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California."This important and meticulously researched work takes on the historiography that argues that the modern Western conception of race had its origins in nineteenth-century scientific constructions of race as a biological category . . . This is an engaging and important work that is sure to attract the attention of historians and scholars from other fields working on issues of race, religion, gender, and colonial empires in Latin America, Europe, and the Atlantic World." (Martha Few <i><i>Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am�rica Latina y el Caribe</i></i>)<br><br>"Through a persuasive analysis of a vast array of archival and published sources, [Martinez] adds depth and complexity to our understanding of religious, cultural, and social framework and of the tensions and contradictions the fiction of limpieza de sangre created in its Mexican settings . . . Martinez's tour de force gives a new meaning to an important subject not seriously addressed previously and should be of great interest to scholars and students." (<i>The Americas</i>)<br><br>"This book provides detailed information about how ideas and information circulated across the Atlantic. Throughout the text, Martinez uses primary documents judiciously and well; particularly fascinating are the descriptions of the processing of probanzas in both local and transatlantic contexts."<br><br>"<i>Genealogical Fictions</i> is the first serious treatment in English of the origins of the <i>sistema de castas</i> and racial ideology in colonial Mexico. It problematizes unquestioned assumptions about <i>limpieza de sangre</i>&#x2015;purity of blood&#x2015;the foundation of the <i>sistema de castas</i>, through a reconstruction of the concept's transformations from its origins in early modern Spain to its adaptations in colonial Mexico. Martinez also has much to say about the development of Mexican society in the seventeenth century, a largely neglected period that is only now beginning to attract the attention of contemporary historians. This is an important and original work and a first-rate addition to the existing literature."

Francis Bacon &#x2014; renowned as a scientist, scholar, and statesman &#x2014; regarded the world as a puzzle to be solved. During the transition between the Renaissance and the early modern era, his methods of inductive reasoning exercised an enormous influence on seventeenth-century Europe. In these essays, Bacon effectively applied his scientific approach of observation and interpretation to human behavior.<br>Bacon originally intended the essays as personal notes, to be shared only with a few friends. He was persuaded to publish an initial installment in 1597, and the volume's continuing popularity led to his revised and enlarged version of 1625. This edition features all 58 essays of the later version, offering a splendid&nbsp; combination of style and substance.</p><p>Francis Bacon was born in London in 1561.

In this pocket-sized reproduction of a whited-out 19th-century volume, Ruefle etches haiku-like minifables, sideways aphorisms, and hauntingly perplexing koans ("the dead/ borrow so little from/ the past/ as if they were alive") from what must have been an unusual text to begin with (Ruefle borrows the book's original title). As much a statement about the act of reading as the act of writing, this is a strange and lovely work by a singular poet. <i>(May 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the&nbsp;small rural&nbsp;town mobilizes a search for the missing child, Rhonda, reeling with guilt, is reminded of another girl who went missing&#x2014;her closest friend from childhood, Lizzy.&nbsp;Joyful memories of their&nbsp;youth spent putting on plays and exploring the woods alternate with darker moments: losing the love of her life, Lizzy&#x2019;s brother, Peter, and the year an increasingly disheveled and moody Lizzy&nbsp;stopped talking to her or anyone else. Past and present merge as Rhonda closes in on the costumed abductor and also on the dark family secrets that tore their&nbsp;perfect childhood apart. McMahon spends a good deal of time setting the stage; however, once the pieces of&nbsp;the intricate plot are in place,&nbsp;readers will be hooked on&nbsp;both the mystery element and the coming-of-age aspects of this atmospheric novel. --Joanne Wilkinson</p><h2>Mutants: On Genetic Variety and the Human Body</h2><p>Visit Armand Marie Leroi on the web: http://armandleroi.com/index.html<p>Stepping effortlessly from myth to cutting-edge science, <b>Mutants</b> gives a brilliant narrative account of our genetic code and the captivating people whose bodies have revealed it&#x2014;a French convent girl who found herself changing sex at puberty; children who, echoing Homer&#x2019;s Cyclops, are born with a single eye in the middle of their foreheads; a village of long-lived Croatian dwarves; one family, whose bodies were entirely covered with hair, was kept at the Burmese royal court for four generations and gave Darwin one of his keenest insights into heredity. This elegant, humane, and engaging book &#x201c;captures what we know of the development of what makes us human&#x201d; (<b>Nature</b>).</p></p><p>Visit Armand Marie Leroi on the web: http://armandleroi.com/index.html<p>Armand Marie Leroi has lived in South Africa, Canada, and the United States. Since 1996, he has been a lecturer in evolutionary genetics at Imperial College, London. He has published widely in technical journals on evolutionary and developmental genetics and writes occasionally for the <b>London Review of Books</b>.</p>This book is "about the making of the human body." Armand Leroi, a reader in evolutionary developmental biology at London's Imperial College, thus joins the multitude of writers who are attempting to gratify our narcissistic focus on "the body." His slant is genetic, and his approach is to employ the story of variation, hence the title and subtitle of his book. Leroi takes vignettes from famous historical cases of human "mutants" to provide interest and background for his discussions of the principles of developmental biology (what used to be called "embryology"). The nature of the subject leads him to emphasize genes and morphogenesis, certainly a fascinating area in recent years. Leroi starts his discussion with famous "monsters" in history -- some mythical, some well known, and some obscure, but all quite interesting. Famous examples include cases of conjoined twins, persons with hypertrichosis, and cyclops. The author is at his best in his lively writing regarding the historical context of these cases. He takes up examples of limb malformations, disorders of stature, and cases of intersex (more commonly known as hermaphroditism). The mysteries and medical theorizing of the past are presented in a sensitive voice and are followed by explanations of the current biologic thinking about the processes that appear to underlie these disorders. Leroi's accounts of the human lives touched by these variations are revealing of our historical biases. For example, he illuminates the curious association between ectrodactyly (the lobster-claw syndrome) and the cruel punishment of two religious dissenters in 1685 and shows how the connection reflects the pervasive belief that malformed children are born as retribution for parental transgression. These stories exhibit the wide range of human variation as well as the sometimes astonishing ways in which the affected human beings have managed to fit within their culture and society. In trying to craft scientific explanations that fit the tone and detail of the historical account, the author runs into a few problems. It is always difficult to convey complex ideas about, say, transcription factors and their role in sex determination to a readership that presumably does not have a detailed knowledge of the entire process of transcription. As the biologist Lewis Wolpert has noted, much of modern science is counterintuitive, so Leroi's task is especially daunting. He has attempted much, but it seems to me that his explanations are apt to be more mystifying than edifying to many readers. To the student of current biology, these passages will be a useful summary, but for the hypothetical "general, well-informed" reader, discussions of morphogens, cell receptors, and aromatase are likely to be underappreciated. Although Leroi simplifies and streamlines as best he can, there are some places where this approach can seem to be misleading -- for example, when he asserts early in the book that mutations are "deficiencies in particular genes." To be fair, toward the end of the book, he tries to reverse this rather flat-footed definition of mutation. Sometimes, too, the distinction between genetic causes and nongenetic developmental accidents (e.g., virus infections) is not made sufficiently clear. Read this book for the fascinating tales of human variation and the lives of those affected; the clinical genetics may also be of interest. <i>William C.

Tomasso Campanella, a Calabrian monk, published <i>The City of the Sun</i> in 1623, and Francis Bacon's <i>The New Atlantis</i> appeared in 1627. Campanella was a student of logic and physics; Bacon focused on politics and philosophy. Despite differences in setting and treatment, both authors employed the latest methods of scientific experimentation to restructure the social order, and both works abound in imaginative thought and expression.<br>Campanella formulated the first scientifically based socialistic system &#x2014; one that furnished a model for subsequent ideal communities. Bacon focused on the duty of the state toward science, and his projections for state-sponsored research anticipated many advances in medicine and surgery, meteorology, and machinery. Both&nbsp;of these&nbsp;classics mirror their period's idealism and its revolutionary trends in thought.</p><p>Statesman and philosopher Francis Bacon (1561&#x2013;1626) was a towering figure of the English Renaissance best known as a champion of the empirical, inductive approach that forms the foundation of the modern scientific method. Bacon's political career culminated in his appointment as Lord Chancellor. Dismissed from his post on charges of corruption, he retired from public life and devoted himself to study and writing. <br>Dominican friar Tomasso Campanella (1568&#x2013;1639) rejected Christian revelation and sought truth in reason and nature. An ardent defender of Galileo and his philosophy, Campanella was imprisoned and tortured by the Inquisition. During his 27 years of confinement, Campanella reverted to Roman Catholic orthodoxy and was ultimately freed by papal intervention.</p><h2>Eyes of the Storm: A Graphic Novel (BONE #3)</h2><p>In "Eyes of the Storm," book three in the epic BONE series, Gran'ma Ben reveals long-kept secrets about Thorn's royal heritage and the ancient enmities that may lead to war.<br><br>In "Eyes of the Storm," volume three of the nine-book BONE saga, Lucius, Smiley, and Phoney survive an attack by the rat creatures and return safely to Lucius' tavern in Barrelhaven. Phoney, desperate to win a bet with Lucius, stokes the townspeople's fear of dragons and boasts that he is a professional dragonslayer. <br><br>Back at the farm, Fone Bone and Thorn are troubled by strange dreams, and Gran'ma Ben's reaction to them is stranger still: She reveals long-kept secrets and warns of great danger. Thorn, Fone Bone, and Gran'ma Ben may have to leave the farm forever.</p><p>As the first Bone trilogy comes to a conclusion, questions are answered, mysteries are revealed, and the stage is set for the brewing conflict in the valley. Jeff Smith is in top form in <i>Bone: Eyes of the Storm</i>. His artful balancing of humor, suspense, and pathos makes for an unforgettable reading experience. The dream sequences in this volume are inspired pieces of comics storytelling, especially the six-page "Moby Bone" sequence: the pacing, illustration, symbolism, and panel layout are close to perfect. A special addition to this collection is a set of more than 40 pages that have been retouched from the already near-perfect original comics. There are also 5 never-before-seen story pages and 9 new illustrations.Crisp masterful cartooning and a story that snaps from humor to suspense to the best kind of sweetness</p><h2>The Hanging Girl: A Department Q Novel</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and internationally bestselling author Jussi Adler-Olsen delivers an exhilarating mystery in the Department Q series, featuring Detective Carl M�rck and his enigmatic assistants, Assad and Rose.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> In the middle of his usual hard-won morning nap in the basement of police headquarters, Carl M�rck, head of Department Q, receives a call from a colleague working on the Danish island of Bornholm.

Flickering shadows and gentle darkness covered her like a blanket and kept her warm.</p><p>In a dream, she had left her body, hovering in the air like a bird. No, even better, like a butterfly. Like a multicolored fluttering piece of art, put in the world only to spread happiness and wonder. Like a hovering being high up between heaven and earth whose magic dust could awaken the world to endless love and happiness.</p><p>She smiled at the thought. It was so beautiful and pure.</p><p>Now the ceaseless darkness above her fought with dim glints like distant stars. It felt good, almost like a pulse conducting the sound of wind and rustling leaves.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t move at all but she didn&#x2019;t want to anyway or she&#x2019;d wake from the dream, and reality would suddenly kick in, and then the pain would come and who would want that?</p><p>Now a myriad of images appeared from life-giving times. Small glimpses of her and her brother hopping out over the sand dunes, parents shouting that they should stop. <i>Stop!</i></p><p>Why was it always <i>stop</i>? Wasn&#x2019;t it there in the dunes that she&#x2019;d felt free for the first time?</p><p>She smiled as beautiful beams of light slid under her like streams of <i>mareel.</i> Not that she had ever seen the milky sea effect before, but it must be like that. <i>Mareel</i> or liquid gold in deep valleys.</p><p>Where was it she&#x2019;d come to?</p><p>Wasn&#x2019;t it a thought of freedom? Yes, that must be it because she&#x2019;d never felt as free as she did just now. A butterfly that was simply its own master. Light and inquisitive with beautiful people around who didn&#x2019;t tell her off. Creative hands in all directions, pushing her forward and only wishing the best for her. Songs that lifted her and which had never been sung before.</p><p>She sighed momentarily and smiled. Allowed her thoughts to take her everywhere and nowhere all at once.</p><p>Then she remembered school and the bike, the icy cold morning and not least her chattering teeth.</p><p>And just in that moment, when reality rushed in, and her heart finally gave up, she also remembered the crack when the car hit her, the sound of bones breaking, the branches of the tree that caught her, the meeting that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Tuesday, April 29th, 2014</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Carl. Wake up. The telephone is ringing again.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl looked up sleepily at Assad, who was camouflaged like a yellow carnival. When he&#x2019;d started in the morning, the overalls had been white and his curly hair black, so if there was even a splash of paint on the walls, it would be a miracle.</p><p>&#x201c;You interrupted me right in the middle of a complicated train of thought,&#x201d; said Carl, reluctantly taking his legs off the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay! Sorry!&#x201d; The wrinkles of a smile appeared under the jungle of Assad&#x2019;s nine o&#x2019;clock stubble. What the heck was it his happy round eyes expressed? A hint of irony, perhaps?</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know it was a late one for you yesterday, Carl,&#x201d; continued Assad. &#x201c;But Rose goes nuts when you let the telephone ring all the time. So could you please just get it next time?&#x201d;</p><p>Carl turned toward a glaring light from the basement window. A little cigarette smoke should put an end to <i>that</i> problem, he thought, reaching out for the pack and slamming his feet back up on the table as the telephone started ringing again.</p><p>Assad pointed at it insistently and slid out the door. It was turning into a hell of a situation with those two loudmouths jabbering at him incessantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Carl,&#x201d; he said, yawning, with the receiver resting on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello!&#x201d; came from below.</p><p>He took the receiver up to his mouth with his arm languid. &#x201c;Who am I talking with?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that Carl M�rck?&#x201d; said a voice in the lilting dialect of Bornholm.</p><p>Definitely not one of the dialects that did it for Carl. It was like bad Swedish with some grammatical errors, and no use anywhere except on the small island in the Baltic.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m Carl M�rck. Isn&#x2019;t that what I just said?&#x201d;</p><p>The sound of a sigh came from the other end. It almost sounded like relief.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Christian Habersaat. We met each other a lifetime ago but you probably don&#x2019;t remember me.&#x201d;</p><p>Habersaat? Carl thought. From Bornholm?</p><p>Carl hesitated. &#x201c;Yeah, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I served at the police station in Nex� when you and a superior were over here some years ago to escort a prisoner to Copenhagen.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl racked his brain. He remembered the prison escort well enough, but Habersaat?</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, right,&#x201d; he said, reaching over for the cigarettes.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sorry for disturbing you but maybe you&#x2019;ve got time to hear me out? I&#x2019;ve read that you&#x2019;ve just solved the complicated case in the circus at Bellah�j. My compliments, although it must feel frustrating when the culprit commits suicide before the trial.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl shrugged. Rose had been frustrated about it but Carl couldn&#x2019;t give a damn. It was just one less asshole in the world to worry about.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, but you aren&#x2019;t calling because of that case, are you?&#x201d; He lit the cigarette and tilted his neck back. It was only one thirty. Far too early to have used up his daily ration of cigarettes, which meant he should probably increase it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes and no. I&#x2019;m calling about that case and everything else that you&#x2019;ve so impressively solved in the last couple of years. As I said, I serve with the Bornholm Police and am currently sitting in R�nne, but I&#x2019;m retiring tomorrow, thank God.&#x201d; He tried to laugh. It sounded forced. &#x201c;Times have changed, so it&#x2019;s not very exciting to be me anymore. No doubt we all feel the same, but only ten years ago I was the guy who knew everything about what was happening on most of the central and east coast districts of the island. Yeah, you could say that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m calling.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl let his head fall. If this guy wanted to convince them to take on a case, he needed to nip this in the bud immediately. He certainly didn&#x2019;t want to get involved with anything connected to an island where the specialty was smoked herring and which was closer to Poland, Sweden, and Germany than to Denmark.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you calling because you want us to look into something for you? Because if that&#x2019;s the case, then I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll need to direct you to our colleagues on one of the floors above us. We&#x2019;ve got far too much to do down here in Department Q.&#x201d;</p><p>It went quiet on the other end of the line. Then the caller hung up.</p><p>Carl stared in bewilderment at the receiver before slamming it down. If the guy was so touchy, then he damn well didn&#x2019;t deserve any better.</p><p>Shaking his head, he&#x2019;d hardly managed to close his eyes before the stupid thing rang again.</p><p>Carl took a deep breath. Some people really needed it hammered home for them.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yes!</i>&#x201d; he shouted into the receiver. Maybe that would scare the idiot into hanging up again.</p><p>&#x201c;Er, Carl? Is that you?&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t the voice he&#x2019;d expected to hear. He frowned. &#x201c;Mom, is that you?&#x201d; he asked tentatively.</p><p>&#x201c;I get really frightened when you holler like that! Do you have a sore throat, sweetie?&#x201d;</p><p>Carl sighed. It had been more than thirty years since he&#x2019;d left home. Since then he&#x2019;d dealt with violent criminals, pimps, arsonists, murderers, and rows of bodies in all manner of degrees of decomposition. He&#x2019;d been shot at. His jaw had been broken as had his wrist, and he&#x2019;d lost his private life and all the respectable ambitions inherent to anyone from Northern Jutland. It had been thirty years since he flew the nest and finally told himself that he was in charge of his own life. Parents were people you could choose to deal with or ignore as you pleased. So how the hell was it possible that she could make him feel like a baby with just a single sentence?</p><p>Carl rubbed his eye and sat up a little in his chair. This was going to be a long, long day.</p><p>&#x201c;No, Mom, I&#x2019;m okay. We&#x2019;ve got workmen in, so you can&#x2019;t hear yourself think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right, well, I&#x2019;m calling you with some very sad news.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl pressed his lips together and tried to gauge her tone. Did she sound sad? Was she about to tell him in a second that his dad was dead? After he hadn&#x2019;t been home to visit them in more than a year?</p><p>&#x201c;Is Dad dead?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Goodness gracious me! Certainly not. He&#x2019;s sitting here beside me drinking a coffee. He&#x2019;s just been out to the stable to dock the piglets. No, it&#x2019;s your cousin Ronny.&#x201d;</p><p>At that, Carl took his legs down from the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Ronny? Dead? How?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He collapsed suddenly out in Thailand while having a massage. Isn&#x2019;t it terrible news on such a beautiful spring day?&#x201d;</p><p>In Thailand, she said, and during a massage. Well, what else could you expect?</p><p>Carl searched for an appropriate answer. It wasn&#x2019;t really something that came naturally to him.</p><p>&#x201c;Terrible, yes,&#x201d; he managed to say while trying to repress a horrible image of the presumably very comfortable end of his cousin&#x2019;s bulk.</p><p>&#x201c;Sammy is flying out in the morning to collect him and his things. Best to get everything home before it&#x2019;s spread to the four winds,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sammy is always so practical.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl nodded. There would probably be a thorough appraisal when Ronny&#x2019;s brother stepped in. The crap in one pile and anything of any worth in the suitcase.</p><p>He imagined Ronny&#x2019;s faithful wife. A stalwart little Thai woman, in fact, who deserved better. But by the time Ronny&#x2019;s brother had searched through the drawers, there wouldn&#x2019;t be much left for her other than the boxers with Chinese dragons. That was the way of the world.</p><p>&#x201c;Ronny was married, Mom. I don&#x2019;t think Sammy can count on just coming and taking what he wants without so much as asking.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. &#x201c;Oh, you know Sammy. It&#x2019;ll be fine. And he&#x2019;s going to stay out there for ten to twelve days. You might as well get a bit of color in your cheeks when you&#x2019;re travelling so far anyway, he says. And he isn&#x2019;t wrong there. He&#x2019;s a smart man, Cousin Sammy.&#x201d;</p><p>Carl nodded. The only significant difference between Ronny and his little brother, Sammy, was a single vowel and three consonants. Nobody living north of the Limfjord could miss that they were related because they were like peas in a pod. If there was a film producer in need of a bragging, self-obsessed, absolutely untrustworthy show-off in a garish shirt, at least Sammy was still available.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve set the date of the funeral for Saturday, May 10th, here in Br�nderslev. It&#x2019;ll be wonderful to see you up here again, son,&#x201d; continued his mom. While the predictable update of the day-to-day life of a country family from Vendsyssel was rattled off, with particular stress on pig farming mixed with his dad&#x2019;s dodgy hip, the usual censure of politicians in Parliament and some other similarly depressing talk, Carl was thinking about the unpleasant tone of Ronny&#x2019;s last e-mail to him.</p><p>That e-mail had undoubtedly been meant as a threat, something that had unsettled and frustrated Carl more than he cared to admit. After a while he came to the conclusion that Ronny intended to blackmail him with the nonsense. Wasn&#x2019;t his cousin exactly the type who would do that? And wasn&#x2019;t he always short of cash?</p><p>Carl didn&#x2019;t like it. Would he now have to deal with that ridiculous claim again? It was utter drivel. But when you lived in the land of Hans Christian Andersen you knew only too well how quickly a little feather could turn into five hens. And five hens of this sort, in his position of trust and with a boss like Lars Bj�rn, was really something he could do without.</p><p>Damn it, what had Ronny been up to? On numerous occasions the idiot had blurted out that he&#x2019;d murdered his dad, which was bad enough in itself. But worse was that he&#x2019;d dragged Carl into the dirt by publicly declaring that Carl had been an accomplice to murdering Ronny&#x2019;s dad during a fishing trip, and in the ominous last e-mail had informed Carl that he&#x2019;d put it in writing as a book and would be attempting to get it published.</p><p>Carl hadn&#x2019;t heard anything since then, but it was a terrible situation that needed to be laid to rest now that the man was dead.</p><p>Carl fumbled again for the cigarettes. Without doubt he should go to the funeral. It would be the place to find out if Sammy had been successful in getting Ronny&#x2019;s wife to surrender some of the inheritance. Similar inheritance cases out east had ended violently, and of course one could hope that might happen again. But Ronny&#x2019;s wife, little what&#x2019;s-her-face, seemed to be made from another and better mold. She&#x2019;d probably keep anything of financial value that belonged to her and give up the rest. And that might include Ronny&#x2019;s alleged attempt at a literary career.</p><p>No, it wouldn&#x2019;t surprise him at all if Sammy succeeded in getting the notes home with him. And if so, then he&#x2019;d better get his hands on them first before they made the family rounds.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that Ronny was really rich in the end, Carl?&#x201d; chirped his mother somewhere in the background.</p><p>Carl raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Really, was he now? We&#x2019;ll have to assume he was dealing in drugs, then. And you&#x2019;re sure he didn&#x2019;t end up with his head in a noose behind the thick prison walls of the Thai justice system?&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed. &#x201c;Oh, Carl. You&#x2019;ve always been such a funny child.&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Twenty minutes after the conversation with the Bornholm policeman, Rose stood in the doorway waving away Carl&#x2019;s tobacco smoke with obvious disgust.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you just spoken with a Sergeant Habersaat, Carl?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. It wasn&#x2019;t exactly the conversation he was thinking about most just now. God only knew what Ronny had written about him.</p><p>&#x201c;Take a look at this.&#x201d; She threw a piece of paper on the table in front of him.</p><p>&#x201c;I got this e-mail two minutes ago.

The tales are concerned with themes such as perception of conflict, self-transformation, the cultivation of chi (life energy), and understanding yin and yang. Some of the parables seem light and fanciful, but they offer the reader valuable lessons on the fundamental principles of the martial arts; &#x201c;The Mysterious Technique of the Cat&#x201d; is iconic. <br><br>The &#x201c;demon&#x201d; in the title story refers to the mythical tengu, who guard the secrets of swordsmanship. A swordsman travels to Mt. Kurama, famous for being inhabited by tengu, and in a series of conversations he learns about mushin (no-mind), strategy, the transformation of chi, and how the path of the sword leads to the understanding of life itself. <br><br>The author, Issai Chozanshi, had a deep understanding of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto, as well as insight into the central role of chi in the universe&#x2014;points that are succinctly explained in William Scott Wilson&#x2019;s fine introduction and extensive endnotes. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to truly understand the philosophical underpinnings of martial arts, and how these principles relate to our existence.</p><p>William Scott Wilson is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture. His best-selling translations include <i>Hagakure</i> and <i>The Book of Five Rings</i>.&#x201c;In keeping with his author's aims, William Scott Wilson, in his elegant and erudite translation, embeds the sermon between a kind of overture and a postlude comprising some of the charming animal allegories to be found in another Chozanshi book, the &#x2018;<i>Inaka</i> <i>Soshi</i>&#x2019; (here winningly rendered as &#x2018;The Hayseed Taoist&#x2019;). The centipede questions the snake, the sea gull and the mayfly discuss the &#x2018;Tao,&#x2019; and the toad speaks of the way of the gods.

All grew up in humble circumstances, each suffered poor health, and none achieved academic distinction or prominent positions in their religious orders. They were, to all appearances, the sort of people others overlook. <br><br> Yet in their lifetimes, untold numbers found physical and interior healing through their ministries, and since their deaths their fame has grown enormously. Their secret was the secret of every successful Christian life: In complete humility, they abandoned themselves to the will of God. <br><br> Bessette and Casey literally answered the door at their monasteries, and Pio was something of a spiritual doorkeeper in the confessional. <i>God's Doorkeepers</i> reveals how these miracle-workers, in spite of their lowly circumstances, inspired and continue to inspire those who seek a healing encounter with God.</p><p><b>JOEL SCHORN</b> is a writer and editor in Chicago.

For over six cruel centuries, tens of thousands died in the blood soaked arenas of Rome and its colonies, watched by enthralled crowds screaming for violence. Professor Fik Meijer has ingeniously pieced together their true stories from contemporary evidence, describing the gladiators' origins, daily life, training, and the odds of their survival pitted against their legions of fans' lust for blood and spectacle.</p></p><p><p>FIK MEIJER is a Professor of Ancient History at the University of Amsterdam and is the author of <i>Emperors Don't Die in Bed. </i>His next book will be a study of Rome's charioteers.</p>Locked in mortal combat before 50,000 cheering spectators in the Colosseum, the two gladiators thrust and parry until the crowd gets what it came for: one dead athlete and one living, victorious athlete. While the games themselves might have been exciting for the Roman crowds, Meijer's listless prose and superficial examination of the gladiator's life and work fails to capture any of the excitement, terror and pride that the gladiators and spectators must have felt. In pedantic fashion, he provides a survey of the different types of gladiators, the kinds of animals they fought, the dimensions of the Colosseum and other amphitheaters and the daily life of a gladiator. As many other books have pointed out, the gladiators themselves were slaves or prisoners of war who were rigorously trained in the sport. Meijer (<i>Emperors Don't Die in Bed</i>), a professor of ancient history at the University of Amsterdam, also describes a typical day at the Colosseum that featured hunters fighting animals, followed by executions of criminals during lunch and finally human combat. Apart from a tendentious and nitpicky critique of the historical accuracy of the films <i>Spartacus </i>and <i>The Gladiator</i>, Meijer adds nothing new to our knowledge about gladiators. 55 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Written in a unique Aramaic, this masterpiece of Kabbalah exceeds the dimensions of a normal book; it is virtually a body of literature, comprising over twenty discrete sections. The bulk of the <i>Zohar</i> consists of a running commentary on the Torah, from Genesis through Deuteronomy. This translation begins and focuses here in what are projected to be ten volumes. Two subsequent volumes will cover other, shorter sections. </p> <p>The <i>Zohar</i>'s commentary is composed in the form of a mystical novel. The hero is Rabbi Shim'on son of Yohai, a saintly disciple of Rabbi Akiva who lived in the second century in the land of Israel. In the <i>Zohar</i>, Rabbi Shim'on and his companions wander through the hills of Galilee, discovering and sharing secrets of Torah.</p> <p>On one level, biblical figures such as Abraham and Sarah are the main characters, and the mystical companions interpret their words, actions, and personalities. On a deeper level, the text of the Bible is simply the starting point, a springboard for the imagination. For example, when God commands Abraham, <i>Lekh lekha, Go forth... to the land that I will show you</i> (Genesis 12:1), Rabbi El'azar ignores idiomatic usage and insists on reading the words more literally than they were intended, hyperliterally: <i>Lekh lekha, Go to yourself!</i> Search deep within to discover your true self.</p> <p>At times, the companions themselves become the main characters, and we read about their dramatic mystical sessions with Rabbi Shim'on or their adventures on the road, for example, an encounter with a cantankerous old donkey driver who turns out to be a master of wisdom in disguise.</p> <p>Ultimately, the plot of the Zohar focuses on the ten <i>sefirot</i>, the various stages of God's inner life, aspects of divine personality, both feminine and masculine. By penetrating the literal surface of the Torah, the mystical commentators transform the biblical narrative into a biography of God. The entire Torah is read as one continuous divine name, expressing divine being. Even a seemingly insignificant verse can reveal the inner dynamics of the <i>sefirot</i>&#x2015;how God feels, responds and acts, how She and He (the divine feminine and masculine) relate intimately with each other and with the world.</p></p><p>&#x201c;This sensitive commentary and translation of the classic text of Kabbalah is of foundational importance for an understanding of &#x201c;Jewish mysticism.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Jewish Book World<br>&#x201c;While translation may be an art, it can also be genuine scholarship of the highest order. . . .

Gu�non held that Hinduism embraces the most ancient, profound, and comprehensive expression of traditional metaphysics we possess, which can in some ways function as a key to every other traditional form, and this work has been called the first reliable exposition of Hindu metaphysics in any Western language. Before Gu�non, the West&#39;s image of Hinduism was a hodge-podge of translated scriptures lacking traditional commentary, fragments of doctrine reported by Jesuits and other missionaries, random impressions of merchants, imperialists, and adventurers, unreliable Eurocentric constructions of the orientalists, and the fantasies of the Theosophical Society and their ilk. To this day, Man and His Becoming remains one of the best (if not the best) expositions of the doctrines of the Vedanta, an exposition entirely free from the modernizing and Westernizing tendencies that first infiltrated the Indian subcontinent under the British Raj, and have not yet abated. This text is a veritable bible of traditional metaphysics and anthropology. In his Studies in Hinduism and Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctines, Gu�non treats historical and cosmological aspects of Hinduism in further detail.</p><p>Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Cat Bible: Everything Your Cat Expects You to Know</h2><p><b>The only fully comprehensive guide to ?all things feline,? from the host of <i>Cat Chat</i> on Martha Stewart Living Radio.</b> <br><br> Finally, a definitive book that delivers many unknown facts about every aspect of caring for and sharing your life with a cat, ranging from proper nutrition and strange behavior to medical care and multi-cat households, to grooming and geriatrics. <i>The Cat Bible</i> explains the mysteries of feline behavior to owners who are devoted to their cats without being able to fully understand them.

Her dazzling new work, <i>An Alchemy of Mind,</i> offers an unprecedented exploration and celebration of the mental fantasia in which we spend our days&#x2014;and does for the human mind what the bestselling <i>A Natural History of the Senses</i> did for the physical senses.<br> <br> Bringing a valuable female perspective to the topic, Diane Ackerman discusses the science of the brain as only she can: with gorgeous, immediate language and imagery that paint an unusually lucid and vibrant picture for the reader. And in addition to explaining memory, thought, emotion, dreams, and language acquisition, she reports on the latest discoveries in neuroscience and addresses controversial subjects like the effects of trauma and male versus female brains. In prose that is not simply accessible but also beautiful and electric, Ackerman distills the hard, objective truths of science in order to yield vivid, heavily anecdotal explanations about a range of existential questions regarding consciousness, human thought, memory, and the nature of identity.</p><p><b>Diane Ackerman</b> is a naturalist and poet and the author of ten books of literary nonfiction, including <i>A Natural History of the Senses, A Natural History of Love,</i> and <i>Cultivating Delight.</i> Also the author of six volumes of poetry and several nonfiction children's books, she contributes to <i>The New York Times, Discover, National Geographic, Parade,</i> and many other publications. Ackerman lives in Ithaca, New York.On the one hand, there is the mind: a web of faculties aware of itself and the universe, capable of learning a new piano sonata or recalling a spring snowstorm 40 years ago. On the other hand, the brain: a three-pound blob. For thousands of years, few people saw a connection between the two. In 1652, the English philosopher Henry More flatly stated that the brain "shows no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet or a bowl of curds." Today, of course, it's clear that the brain is far more than goop. Electricity and neurotransmitters shuttle among its billions of neurons, producing our passions, reasoning and consciousness. Yet most of us still have trouble feeling a link between the details of the brain -- its oligodendrites, its nodes of Ranvier, its alpha-2A noradrenergic receptors -- and our own existence.<p> In recent years this chasm has attracted a corps of bridge-builders. They have packed shelves with books that try to link neuroscience to every aspect of our lives. The latest addition is An Alchemy of Mind, by Diane Ackerman. In some ways Ackerman's book is not much different from the rest. She surveys the same well-traveled territories, with chapters on topics such as consciousness, language and the mental differences between the sexes. If you keep up with brain research news in The Washington Post, there won't be many scientific surprises for you here. But Ackerman is unusual in that she writes not as a scientist or a science journalist. Instead, she's a poet (albeit a poet with a remarkable appetite for journals with names like Cerebrum). And it's as a poet that she shows her greatest strengths in writing on the brain, as well as her greatest weaknesses.</p><p> Ackerman knows that poetry and fiction are full of profound insights into the workings of the mind. She knows how to pluck a passage out of Proust, Shakespeare or Virginia Woolf to illustrate a point. In some cases she chooses instead to lyrically recall an experience of her own (such as her personal experience with the blending of sensation known as synesthesia). But she also knows that literature can illuminate that mind in a different way. The mark of a great author is the ability to bootstrap language to higher levels of meaning with the help of symbols, metaphors and figures of speech. And the brain, at its most basic level of information-processing, depends on a similar sort of poetic bootstrapping. It doesn't passively reproduce the sensations that enter its neurons as into a pinhole camera. Instead, it grabs a limited number of details and then builds around them an elaborate hypothesis about the world. "We are all unwitting poets," Ackerman says.</p><p> Ackerman spends much of An Alchemy of Mind turning her metaphor-making neurons back on themselves to find captivating ways to describe how the brain works. Heaven knows neuroscience could use an infusion of poetry. When scientists (and science writers) try to describe the brain to the public, they are too easily satisfied with feeble metaphors. Receptors are locks, for example, and neurotransmitters are keys. Yet keys and locks are rigid, as Ackerman points out, while receptors and neurotransmitters are yielding and floppy. Someone needs to find a new metaphor, and she offers some that are both evocative and meaningful, as when she refers to short-term memory as a "mental scratch pad." But too often she offers mud instead of light.</p><p>"Most children don't remember much before the age of two or three," she informs us, "because the cortex develops slowly and the brain hasn't activated its thinking cap yet." Thinking cap? What exactly does that mean? You can scour an entire neurology textbook and still not be able to answer that question. Describing how music is encoded in memory, Ackerman writes about neurons producing proteins "which then return to the synapse where the music was being processed and glue that music to the site." A miniature jukebox now dangles from a nerve, making us none the wiser.</p><p> A bad metaphor can do more than just befuddle. It can give a reader precisely the wrong idea about how nature works. Those who hope to learn the basics about the brain in An Alchemy of Mind will sometimes be misled by pretty-sounding language. Ackerman informs us, for example, that our ancestors were faced with the paradox of getting a big human brain out of a mother's narrow birth canal. "The solution we found was to give birth earlier," she declares, as if our ancestors convened a meeting where they voted to redesign their genome. Still, Ackerman deserves credit for taking on what is an important mission -- a mission that is, at least for the moment, doomed to failure.</p><p> She's right when she says that "no image English offers -- say, of dominoes, ricochets, echoes, or ripples -- can capture how in the brain everything affects everything else all at once, or how our everythingness always lingers in mind as we engage the everythingness of everyone else." Despite the shortcomings of our ideas and our language, we must keep searching for new ways to express the workings of the brain. It is in those images, more and more, that we see ourselves. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Carl Zimmer</p><p></p><p>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Maya Duran is a single mother struggling to balance a demanding job at Istanbul University with the challenges of raising a teenage son. Her worries increase when she is tasked with looking after the enigmatic Maximilian Wagner, an elderly German-born Harvard professor visiting the city at the university's invitation. Although he is distant at first, Maya gradually learns of the tragic circumstances that brought him to Istanbul sixty years before, and the dark realities that continue to haunt him. <br><br>Inspired by the 1942 <i>Struma</i> disaster, in which nearly 800 Jewish refugees perished after the ship carrying them to Palestine was torpedoed off the coast of Turkey, <i>Serenade for Nadia </i>is both a poignant love story and a gripping testament to the power of human connection in crisis.</p><p><b>Z�lf�</b> <b>Livaneli </b>is Turkey&#x2019;s bestselling author, a celebrated composer and film director, and a political activist.

It guides readers through the camera features with step-by-step setting adjustments; color illustrations; and detailed how, when, and why explanations for each option. Every button, dial, switch, and menu configuration setting is explored in a user-friendly manner, with suggestions for setup according to various shooting styles.<br><br>Darrell's friendly and informative writing style allows readers to easily follow directions, while feeling as if a friend dropped in to share his knowledge.

His stories have been featured on <i>This American Life </i>and <i>Selected Shorts</i>. As screenwriters/ directors, he and his wife, Shira Geffen, won the 2007 Palme d'Or for Best Debut Feature (<i>Jellyfish</i>) at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>Advocates of flash fiction contend you can say a lot with a little. Unfortunately, you can also say a little with a little. Israeli writer Keret (<i>The Nimrod Flipout</i>) confirms both with this hodgepodge of 46 sketches, culled from his first collection. There are whimsical tales like Nothing, about a woman who loved a man who was made of nothing because this love would never betray her, and Freeze! about a guy who can stop the world and uses the power to score with hot girls. Despite an appealing, comic voice, many of these pieces feel insubstantial and leave the reader indifferent. Nevertheless, a haunting theme arises as stories featuring violence accumulate: Not Human Beings, in which an Israeli soldier is beaten by fellow officers when he objects to the cruel treatment of an old Arab man, screams in the face of bloodshed, whereas the irritation of the father in A Bet, when TV news reports on an Arab sentenced to death preempts an episode of Moonlighting, suggests how violence has been normalized. Keret demonstrates how the same short form that produces ineffective trifles can also create moments of startling power. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In choosing the selections, the editors sought to avoid representing the country only in terms of its long experience of conflict, racism, and violence. And so, while offering many perspectives on that violence, this anthology portrays Guatemala as a real place where people experience joys and sorrows that cannot be reduced to the contretemps of resistance and repression. It includes not only the opinions of politicians, activists, and scholars, but also poems, songs, plays, jokes, novels, short stories, recipes, art, and photographs that capture the diversity of everyday life in Guatemala. The editors introduce all of the selections, from the first piece, an excerpt from the Popol Vuh, a mid-sixteenth-century text believed to be the single most important source documenting pre-Hispanic Maya culture, through the final selections, which explore contemporary Guatemala in relation to neoliberalism, multiculturalism, and the dynamics of migration to the United States and of immigrant life.

Gerber, bestselling author of The E-Myth Revisited shares his powerful insights to lead independent physicians to successful practices and enriched lives.</b></p> <p>Michael Gerber has dedicated much of his professional life to the study of entrepreneurship and business dynamics. His E-Myth Academy is renown in the entrepreneurial world for its business insight and guidance as well as its inspirational advice.</p> <p>In the <i>E-Myth Physician</i>, bestselling author Gerber returns to his roots in order to provide indispensable advice to doctors who own and run their own practices. Gerber provides excellent business insights into topics such as streamlining systems, effective small-business management practices, healthy patient relations and managing cash flow, all with the goal of freeing physicians from the daily grind of running a business and leading them to a happier and more productive life while doing the job they love - practising medicine.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michael E. Gerber</strong> is a true legend of entrepreneurship. The editors of <em>INC</em> magazine called him&nbsp;"The World's #1 Small Business Guru." He is Co-founder and Chairman of the Michael E. Gerber Companies&#x2014;a group of highly unique enterprises dedicated to creating world-class start-ups and entrepreneurs in every industry and economy. The Gerber Companies transforms the way small business owners grow their enterprises and has evolved into an empire over its history of nearly three decades.</p>Gerber has had great success with his previous E-Myth books, and this is the sixth in the series. The E-Myth posits that, because most professional business owners are successful in their field, they assume they are going to be successful entrepreneurs as well, and this assumption often leads to failure. In doctors' harried world, time is at such a premium that the ability to work<i> </i>on their practice (Systems Thinking) is usually superseded by the need to continue working<i> in</i> their practice (Tactical Thinking). As a result, the practice suffers, with patients frustrated by waiting, a tense and impatient staff, and poor cash flow. The E-Myth teachings show the doctor how to regain control over her practice, not by trying to manage people better (which is impossible) but by creating a repeatable system<i> </i>that anyone can follow to success. By focusing and creating a sound business plan, the physician creates a supportive environment for himself, his staff, and his patients, which allows him to get back to what he does best--healing. <i>David Siegfried</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet the corporatisation of the contemporary university has sped up the clock, demanding increased speed and efficiency from faculty regardless of the consequences for education and scholarship.</p><p>In <em>The Slow Professor</em>, Maggie Berg and Barbara K. Seeber discuss how adopting the principles of the Slow movement in academic life can counter this erosion of humanistic education. Focusing on the individual faculty member and his or her own professional practice, Berg and Seeber present both an analysis of the culture of speed in the academy and ways of alleviating stress while improving teaching, research, and collegiality. <em>The Slow Professor</em> will be a must-read for anyone in academia concerned about the frantic pace of contemporary university life.</p></p><p><strong>Maggie Berg</strong> is a professor in the Department of English at Queen&#x2019;s University.

Machine Learning is a huge topic, and the chapter serves as a great introduction. I loved the California housing data example&#x2014;very relevant for business analytics. The chapter was visually stunning.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Alison Sanchez, Assistant Professor in Economics, University of San Diego</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A great introduction to Big Data concepts, notably Hadoop, Spark, and IoT. The examples are extremely realistic and practical. The authors do an excellent job of combining programming and data science topics. The material is presented in digestible sections accompanied by engaging interactive examples. Nearly all concepts are accompanied by a worked-out example. A comprehensive overview of object-oriented programming in Python&#x2014;the use of card image graphics is sure to engage the reader.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Garrett Dancik, Eastern Connecticut State University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Covers some of the most modern Python syntax approaches and introduces community standards for style and documentation. The machine learning chapter does a great job of walking people through the boilerplate code needed for ML in Python. The case studies accomplish this really well. The later examples are so visual. Many of the model evaluation tasks make for really good programming practice. I can see readers feeling really excited about playing with the animations.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Elizabeth Wickes, Lecturer, School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;An engaging, highly accessible book that will foster curiosity and motivate beginning data scientists to develop essential foundations in Python programming, statistics, data manipulation, working with APIs, data visualization, machine learning, cloud computing, and more. Great walkthrough of the Twitter APIs&#x2014;sentiment analysis piece is very useful. I&#x2019;ve taken several classes that cover natural language processing and this is the first time the tools and concepts have been explained so clearly. I appreciate the discussion of serialization with JSON and pickling and when to use one or the other&#x2014;with an emphasis on using JSON over pickle&#x2014;good to know there&#x2019;s a better, safer way!&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Jamie Whitacre, Data Science Consultant</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;For a while, I have been looking for a book in Data Science using Python that would cover the most relevant technologies. Well, my search is over. A must-have book for any practitioner of this field. The machine learning chapter is a real winner!! The dynamic visualization is fantastic.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Ramon Mata-Toledo, Professor, James Madison University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I like the new combination of topics from computer science, data science, and stats. This is important for building data science programs that are more than just cobbling together math and computer science courses. A book like this may help facilitate expanding our offerings and using Python as a bridge for computer and data science topics. For a data science program that focuses on a single language (mostly), I think Python is probably the way to go.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Lance Bryant, Shippensburg University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll develop applications using industry standard libraries and cloud computing services.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Daniel Chen, Data Scientist, Lander Analytics</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Great introduction to Python! This book has my strongest recommendation both as an introduction to Python as well as Data Science.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Shyamal Mitra, Senior Lecturer, University of Texas</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;IBM Watson is an exciting chapter. The code examples put together a lot of Watson services in a really nifty example.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Daniel Chen, Data Scientist, Lander Analytics</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Fun, engaging real-world examples will encourage readers to conduct meaningful data analyses. Provides many of the best explanations of data science concepts I&#x2019;ve encountered. Introduces the most useful starter machine learning models&#x2014;does a good job explaining how to choose the best model and what &#x2018;the best&#x2019; means. Great overview of all the big data technologies with relevant examples.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Jamie Whitacre, Data Science Consultant</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A great introduction to deep learning.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Alison Sanchez, University of San Diego</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;The best designed Intro to Data Science/Python book I have seen.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Roland DePratti, Central Connecticut State University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I like the new combination of topics from computer science, data science, and stats.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Lance Bryant, Shippensburg University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s applied approach should engage readers. A fantastic job providing background on various machine learning concepts without burdening the users with too many mathematical details.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Garrett Dancik, Assoc. Prof. of Computer Science/Bioinformatics, Eastern Connecticut State University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Helps readers leverage the large number of existing libraries to accomplish tasks with minimal code. Concepts are accompanied by rich Python examples that readers can adapt to implement their own solutions to data science problems. I like that cloud services are used.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;David Koop, Assistant Professor, U-Mass Dartmouth</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I enjoyed the OOP chapter&#x2014;doctest unit testing is nice because you can have the test in the actual docstring so things are traveling together. The line-by-line explanations of the static and dynamic visualizations of the die rolling example are just great.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Daniel Chen, Data Scientist, Lander Analytics</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A lucid exposition of the fundamentals of Python and Data Science. Thanks for pointing out seeding the random number generator for reproducibility. I like the use of dictionary and set comprehensions for succinct programming. &#x2018;List vs. Array Performance: Introducing %timeit&#x2019; is convincing on why one should use ndarrays. Good defensive programming. Great section on Pandas Series and DataFrames&#x2014;one of the clearest expositions that I have seen. The section on data wrangling is excellent. Natural Language Processing is an excellent chapter! I learned a tremendous amount going through it.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Shyamal Mitra, Senior Lecturer, University of Texas</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I like the discussion of exceptions and tracebacks. I really liked the Data Mining Twitter chapter; it focused on a real data source and brought in a lot of techniques for analysis (e.g., visualization, NLP). I like that the Python modules helped hide some of the complexity. Word clouds look cool.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;David Koop, Assistant Professor, U-Mass Dartmouth</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I love the book! The examples are definitely a high point.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Dr. Irene Bruno, George Mason University</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I was very excited to see this book. I like its focus on data science and a general purpose language for writing useful data science programs. The data science portion distinguishes this book from most other introductory Python books.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Dr. Harvey Siy, University of Nebraska at Omaha</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve learned a lot in this review process, discovering the exciting field of AI. I&#x2019;ve liked the Deep Learning chapter, which has left me amazed with the things that have already been achieved in this field.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Jos� Antonio Gonz�lez Seco, Consultant</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;An impressive hands-on approach to programming meant for exploration and experimentation.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Elizabeth Wickes, Lecturer, School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I was impressed at how easy it was to get started with NLP using Python. A meaningful overview of deep learning concepts, using Keras. I like the streaming example.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;David Koop, Assistant Professor, U-Mass Dartmouth</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Really like the use of f-strings, instead of the older string-formatting methods. Seeing how easy TextBlob is compared to base NLTK was great. I never made word clouds with shapes before, but I can see this being a motivating example for people getting started with NLP. I&#x2019;m enjoying the case-study chapters in the latter parts of the book. They are really practical. I really enjoyed working through all the Big Data examples, especially the IoT ones.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Daniel Chen, Data Scientist, Lander Analytics</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;I really liked the live IPython input-output. The thing that I like most about this product is that it is a Deitel &amp; Deitel book (I&#x2019;m a big fan) that covers Python.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Dr. Mark Pauley, University of Nebraska at Omaha </i> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Gulliver&#39;s Travels (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Doreen Roberts, Rutherford College, University of Kent at Canterbury Jonathan Swift&#39;s classic satirical narrative was first published in 1726, seven years after Defoe&#39;s Robinson Crusoe (one of its few rivals in fame and breadth of appeal).

Toopka stood close to her knee. Sparks skittered across the doneel child&#x2019;s furry hand where she clasped the flowing, soft material of Kale&#x2019;s wizard robe. Kale frowned down at her ward. The little doneel spent too much time attached to her skirts to be captivated by the light show.<br><br>Instead, Toopka glowered into the forbidding corridor. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s down there?&#x201d;<br><br>Kale sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it the dungeon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we have a dungeon.&#x201d;<br><br>Toopka furrowed her brow in confusion. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know? It&#x2019;s your castle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A castle built by committee.&#x201d; Kale&#x2019;s face grimaced at the memory of weeks of creative chaos. She put her hand on Toopka&#x2019;s soft head.<br><br>The doneel dragged her gaze away from the stairway, tilted her head back, and frowned at her guardian. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s &#x2018;by committee&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You remember, don&#x2019;t you? It was just five years ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember the wizards coming and the pretty tents in the meadow.&#x201d; Toopka pursed her lips. &#x201c;And shouting. I remember shouting.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;They were shouting because no one was listening. Twenty-one wizards came for the castle raising. Each had their own idea about what we needed. So they each constructed their fragment of the castle structure according to their whims.&#x201d;<br><br>Toopka giggled.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s funny. The chunks of castle were erected, juxtaposed with the others, but not as a whole unit. I thank Wulder that at least my parents had some sense. My mother and father connected the tads, bits, and smidgens together with steps and short halls. When nothing else would work, they formed gateways from one portion to another.&#x201d;<br><br>The little doneel laughed out loud and hid her face in Kale&#x2019;s silky wizard&#x2019;s robe. Miniature lightning flashes enveloped Toopka&#x2019;s head and cascaded down her neck, over her back, and onto the floor like a waterfall of sparks.<br><br>Kale cut off the flow of energy and placed a hand on the doneel&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Surely you remember this, Toopka.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked up, her face growing serious. &#x201c;I was very young then.&#x201d; <br><br>Kale narrowed her eyes and examined the child&#x2019;s innocent face. &#x201c;As long as I have known you, you&#x2019;ve appeared to be the same age. Are you ever going to grow up?&#x201d;<br><br>Toopka shrugged, then the typical smile of a doneel spread across her face. Her thin black lips stretched, almost reaching from ear to ear.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m growing up as fast as I can, but I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m the one in charge. If I were in charge, I would be big enough to have my own dragon, instead of searching for yours.&#x201d;<br><br>The statement pulled Kale back to her original purpose. No doubt she had been manipulated yet again by the tiny doneel, but dropping the subject of Toopka&#x2019;s age for the time being seemed prudent. Kale rubbed the top of Toopka&#x2019;s head. The shorter fur between her ears felt softer than the hair on the child&#x2019;s arms. Kale always found it soothing to stroke Toopka&#x2019;s head, and the doneel liked it as well.<br><br>Kale let her hand fall to her side and pursued their mission. &#x201c;Gally and Mince have been missing for a day and a half. We must find them. Taylaminkadot said she heard an odd noise when she came down to the storeroom.&#x201d; Kale squared her shoulders and took a step down into the dark, dank stairwell. &#x201c;Gally and Mince may be down here, and they may be in trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can you know who&#x2019;s missing?&#x201d; Toopka tugged on Kale&#x2019;s robe, letting loose a spray of sparkles. &#x201c;You have hundreds of minor dragons in the castle and more big dragons in the fields.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Kale put her hand in front of her, and a globe of light appeared, resting on her palm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Dragon Keeper. I know when any of my dragons have missed a meal or two.&#x201d; She stepped through the doorway.<br><br>Toopka tugged on Kale&#x2019;s gown. &#x201c;May I have a light too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; She handed the globe to the doneel. The light flickered. Kale tapped it, and the glow steadied. She produced another light to sit in her own hand and proceeded down the steps.<br><br>Toopka followed, clutching the sparkling cloth of Kale&#x2019;s robe in one hand and the light in the other. &#x201c;I think we should take a dozen guards with us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s anything scary down here, Toopka. After all, as you reminded me, this is our castle, and we certainly haven&#x2019;t invited anything nasty to live with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the things that come uninvited that worry me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right. Just a moment.&#x201d; Kale turned to face the archway at the top of the stairs, a few steps up from where they stood. She reached with her mind to the nearest band of minor dragons. Soon chittering dragon voices, a rainbow vision of soft, flapping, leathery wings, and a ripple of excitement swept through her senses. She heard Artross, the leader of this watch, call for his band to mind their manners, listen to orders, and calm themselves.<br><br>Kale smiled her greeting as they entered the stairway and circled above her. She turned to Toopka, pleased with her solution, but Toopka scowled. Obviously, the doneel was not impressed with the arrival of a courageous escort.<br><br>Kale opened her mouth to inform Toopka that a watch of dragons provides sentries, scouts, and fighters. And Bardon had seen to their training. But the doneel child knew this.<br><br>Each watch formed without a Dragon Keeper&#x2019;s instigation. Usually eleven to fifteen minor dragons developed camaraderie, and a leader emerged. A social structure developed within each watch. Kale marveled at the process. Even though she didn&#x2019;t always understand the choices, she did nothing to alter the natural way of establishing the hierarchy and respectfully worked with what was in place.<br><br>Artross, a milky white dragon who glowed in the dark, had caught Kale&#x2019;s affections. She sent a warm greeting to the serious-minded leader and received a curt acknowledgment. The straight-laced young dragon with his tiny, mottled white body tickled her. Although they didn&#x2019;t look alike in the least, Artross&#x2019;s behavior reminded Kale of her husband&#x2019;s personality.<br><br>Kale nodded at Toopka and winked. &#x201c;Now we have defenders.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; said the doneel, letting go of Kale&#x2019;s robe and stepping down a stair, &#x201c;it would be better if they were bigger and carried swords.&#x201d;<br><br>Kale smiled as one of the younger dragons landed on her shoulder. He pushed his violet head against her chin, rubbing with soft scales circling between small bumps that looked like stunted horns. Toopka skipped ahead with the other minor dragons flying just above her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Crain,&#x201d; said Kale, using a fingertip to stroke his pink belly. She&#x2019;d been at his hatching a week before. The little dragon chirred his contentment. &#x201c;With your love of learning, I&#x2019;m surprised you&#x2019;re not in the library with Librettowit.&#x201d;<br><br>A scene emerged in Kale&#x2019;s mind from the small dragon&#x2019;s thoughts. She hid a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you got thrown out, but you must not bring your snacks into Librettowit&#x2019;s reading rooms. A tumanhofer usually likes a morsel of food to tide him over, but not when the treat threatens to smudge the pages of his precious books.&#x201d; She felt the small beast shudder at the memory of the librarian&#x2019;s angry voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Crain. He&#x2019;ll forgive you and let you come back into his bookish sanctum.<br><br>And he&#x2019;ll delight in helping you find all sorts of wonderful facts.&#x201d; Toopka came scurrying back. She&#x2019;d deserted her lead position in the company of intrepid dragons. The tiny doneel dodged behind Kale and once more clutched the sparkling robe. Kale shifted her attention to a commotion ahead and sought out the thoughts of the leader Artross.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; asked Kale, but her answer came as she tuned in to the leader of the dragon watch.<br><br>Artross trilled orders to his subordinates. Kale saw the enemy through the eyes of this friend.<br><br>An anvilhead snake slid over the stone floor of a room stacked high with large kegs. His long black body stretched out from a nook between two barrels. With the tail of the serpent hidden, she had no way of knowing its size. These reptiles&#x2019; heads outweighed their bodies. The muscled section behind the base of the jaws could be as much as six inches wide.<br><br>But the length of the snake could be from three feet to thirty. Kale shuddered but took another step down the passage. Artross looked around the room and spotted another section of ropelike body against the opposite wall. Kegs hid most of the snake.<br><br>Kale grimaced. <i>Another snake? Or the end of the one threatening my<br>dragons?<br></i><br>The viper&#x2019;s heavy head advanced, and the distant portion moved with the same speed.<br><br><i>One snake.<br></i><br>&#x201c;Toopka, stay here,&#x201d; she ordered and ran down the remaining steps. She tossed the globe from her right hand to her left and pulled her sword from its hiding place beneath her robe. Nothing appeared to be in her hand, but Kale felt the leather-bound hilt secure in her grip.<br><br>The old sword had been given to her by her mother, and Kale knew how to use the invisible blade with deadly precision. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let him get away,&#x201d; she called as she increased her speed through the narrow corridor.<br><br>The wizard robe dissolved as she rushed to join her guard. Her long dress of azure and plum reformed itself into leggings and a tunic. The color drained away and returned as a pink that would rival a stunning sunset. When she reached the cold, dark room, she cast her globe into the air. Floating in the middle of the room, it tripled in size and gave off a brighter light.<br><br>The dragons circled above the snake, spitting their caustic saliva with great accuracy. Kale&#x2019;s skin crawled at the sight of the coiling reptile. More and more of the serpentine body emerged from the shadowy protection of the stacked kegs. Obviously, the snake did not fear these intruders.<br><br>Even covered with splotches of brightly colored spit, the creature looked like the loathsome killer it was. Kale&#x2019;s two missing dragons could have been dinner for the serpent. She searched the room with the talent Wulder had bestowed upon her and concluded the little ones still lived.<br><br>The reptile hissed at her, raised its massive head, and swayed in a threatening posture. The creature slithered toward her, propelled by the elongated body still on the floor. Just out of reach of Kale&#x2019;s sword, the beast stopped, pulled its head back for the strike, and let out a slow, menacing hiss. The snake lunged, and Kale swung her invisible weapon.<br><br>The severed head sailed across the room and slammed against the stone wall.<br><br>Kale eyed the writhing body for a moment. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be eating any more small animals.&#x201d; She turned her attention to the missing dragons and pointed her sword hand at a barrel at the top of one stack. &#x201c;There. Gally and Mince are in that keg.&#x201d;<br><br>Several dragons landed on the wooden staves, and a brown dragon examined the cask to determine how best to open it. Toopka ran into the room and over to the barrel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help.&#x201d;<br><br>Kale tilted her head. &#x201c;There is also a nest of snake eggs.&#x201d; She consulted the dragon most likely to know facts about anvilhead vipers. Crain landed on her shoulder and poured out all he knew in a combination of chittering and thoughts.<br><br>The odd reptiles preferred eating young farm animals, grain, and feed. They did nothing to combat the population of rats, insects, and vermin. No farmer allowed the snakes on his property if he could help it. &#x201c;Find the nest,&#x201d; Kale ordered. &#x201c;Destroy them all.&#x201d;<br><br>The watch of dragons took flight again, zooming into lightrockilluminated passages leading off from this central room. Kale waited until a small group raised an alarm. Four minor dragons had found the nest.<br><br>She plunged down a dim passage, sending a plume of light ahead and calling for the dispersed dragons to join her. Eleven came from the other corridors, and nine flew in a V formation in front of her. Gally and Mince landed on her shoulders.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all right. I&#x2019;m so glad.&#x201d;<br><br>They scooted next to her neck, shivering. From their minds she deciphered the details of their ordeal. A game of hide-and-seek had led them into the depths of the castle. When the snake surprised them, they&#x2019;d flown under the off-center lid of the barrel. As Mince dove into the narrow opening, he knocked the top just enough for it to rattle down into place. This successfully kept the serpent out, but also trapped them within.<br><br>Kale offered sympathy, and they cuddled against her, rubbing their heads on her chin as she whisked through the underground tunnel in pursuit of the other dragons. <br><br>Numerous rooms jutted off the main hallway, each stacked with boxes, crates, barrels, and huge burlap bags. Kale had no idea this vast amount of storage lay beneath the castle. Taylaminkadot, their efficient housekeeper and wife to Librettowit, probably had a tally sheet listing each item. Kale and the dragons passed rooms that contained fewer and fewer supplies until the stores dwindled to nothing.<br><i><br>How long does this hallway continue on? </i>She slowed to creep along and tiptoed over the stone floor, noticing the rougher texture under her feet. Approaching a corner, she detected the four minor dragons destroying the snake&#x2019;s nest in the next room. Her escort of flying dragons veered off into the room, and she followed. The small dragons swooped over the nest, grabbed an egg, then flew to the beamed roof of the storage room. They hurled the eggs to the floor, and most broke open on contact. Some had more rubbery shells, a sign that they would soon hatch. The minor dragons attacked these eggs with tooth and claw. Once the shell gave way, the content was pulled out and examined.<br><br>No hatchling snake survived. The smell alone halted Kale in her tracks and sent her back a pace. She screwed up her face, but no amount of pinching her nose muscles cut off the odor of raw eggs and the bodies of unborn snakes. She produced a square of moonbeam material from her pocket and covered the lower half of her face. The properties of the handkerchief filtered the unpleasant aroma.<br><br>Her gaze fell on the scene of annihilation. Usually, Kale found infant animals to be endearing, attractive in a gangly way. But the small snake bodies looked more like huge blackened worms than babies. Toopka raced up behind her and came to a skidding stop when she reached the doorway. &#x201c;Ew!&#x201d; She buried her face in the hem of Kale&#x2019;s tunic, then peeked out with her nose still covered. <br><br>The minor dragons continued to destroy the huge nest. Kale estimated over a hundred snake eggs must have been deposited in the old shallow basket. The woven edges sagged where the weight of the female snake had broken the reeds. Kale shuddered at the thought of all those snakes hatching and occupying the lowest level of the castle, her home.<br><br>The urge to be above ground, in the light, and with her loved ones compelled her out of the room. <i>Good work, </i>she commended the dragons as she backed into the passage. <i>Artross, be sure that no egg is left unshattered. </i>She received his assurance, thanked him, then turned about and ran. She must find Bardon.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait for me!&#x201d; Toopka called. Her tiny, booted feet pounded the stone floor in a frantic effort to catch up.</p><h2>Mary Poppins from A to Z</h2><p>P. L.

Paul Scalia reveals a scholar's mind and a pastor's heart in these inspiring reflections on a wide range of Catholic teachings and practices. Rooted in Scripture, the beauty and truth of these insights places the reader on a path to a deeper, more meaningful relationship with God. While keeping the focus on the theology and teachings of the Church, Fr. Scalia also covers these topics:</p><ul><li>shows the unity that comes from the seven sacraments</li><li>provides a road map to a life of grace</li><li>encourages a strong devotion to our Blessed Mother</li><li>provides guidance on how to develop a continuous conversation with God</li></ul><p>These ponderings are coupled with powerful and moving introductory essays penned by highly regarded Catholics, each offering a glimpse into the Catholic faith realized. <b>Rev. Paul Check</b>, <b>Jim Towey</b>, <b>Dr. Scott Hahn</b>, <b>Mary Ellen Bork</b>, <b>Gloria Purvis</b>, <b>Raymond Arroyo</b>, <b>Lizz Lovett</b> and <b>Helen Alvare</b> each open a section of the book with a personal account of his or her interaction with the faith. Fr. Scalia's writings then offer insight into developing and growing one's faith and relationship with God. Additionally, <b>Archbishop Charles Chaput</b> offers a thought provoking foreword to help the reader with a meaningful journey through the many aspects of the Catholic faith presented throughout this book.</p></p><p><p><b>Father Paul Scalia</b> is a native of Virginia and grew up in the Diocese of Arlington. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in Rome.

He has written for various publications, served as a frequent contributor to the <i>Arlington Catholic Herald</i> and <i>Encourage and Teach</i>, the diocesan blog.</p>"Sacraments are symbols that convey the reality they signify. All other signs remain distinct from the things they signify. Only sacraments bring about what they signify. Sacramental signs convey the sacred reality itself. There can be no more perfect communication than this. Only God could express Himself in this way." --<b>Scott Hahn</b>, from the Introduction to Chapter IV, <i>The Sacraments</i><br><br>"One of the blessings of being a Catholic is discovering we are part of a large extended family of holy people. Their stories cover many centuries and diverse cultures, and knowing them, we come to a better understanding of Christ, the One they loved and followed." --<b>Mary Ellen Bork</b>, from the Introduction to Chapter VI, <i>The Saints</i><br><br>"As I read my friend Fr. Paul's moving and rich reflections on various feast days, an image from my childhood returned. It is of a Corpus Christi procession through the French Quarter around St. Louis Cathedral. Once again that eternal clash of the sacred and the profane that the rest of the world tries to ignore or deny is made manifest. This is what feast days are all about: dedicated times for us to stop and experience the deeper spiritual reality beyond the blur of our chaotic lives." --<b>Raymond Arroyo</b>, from the Introduction to Chapter IX, <i>Feasts: The Pattern and Rhythm of the Christian Life</i></p><h2>The Merry Spinster: Tales of Everyday Horror</h2><p><p>From Mallory Ortberg comes a collection of darkly mischievous stories based on classic fairy tales.

Now, one man's fate may threaten the very leaders of Rome itself.</p></p><p>My high school Latin teacher -- Sister Ethelreda, are you out there in cyberspace? -- enthralled her class for four years with her tales of ancient Rome, from culinary trivia to the deeds of the noble generals and the great Roman patriots. It was her hope, as she said, not only to teach us this beautiful language but to be able to bring to life for us the people who formed the vibrant culture that was Rome's. I heard an echo of her words many years later when I read THE FAR ARENA, in which the protagonist wished earnestly to be able to turn a doorknob in time and find the Roman behind the door.<br><br>With Steven Saylor's mysteries, we have that Roman behind the door. Set in ancient Rome before the rise of Julius Caesar, these are not your usual cozy reads. His detective, Gordianus the Finder, seems a scruffy sort, not a noble Roman from the history books by any means, and his Rome is a rough-and-tumble place full of noisy street vendors and con artists as well as more well-to-do, upstanding citizens, a city full of gossip and intrigue and nasty politics as vicious as anything we see today. The noble Romans do appear in his books, of course, but they're a far cry from the bloodless statues who watch serenely from the covers of Latin books as students painstakingly translate their dry speeches. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for one, appears in CATILINA'S RIDDLE not as a statesman but as an underhanded schemer obsessed with destroying Lucius Sergius Catilina, who has gone down in history, rightly or wrongly, as a man who attempted to bring down the Roman Republic.

Sextus Roscius is accused of killing his own father. This, in a society rife with deceit, betrayal, and conspiracy, where neither citizen nor slave can be trusted to speak the truth. But even Gordianus is not prepared for the spectacularly dangerous fireworks that will attend the resolution of this ugly, delicate case....</p><h2>Find Me Unafraid: Love, Loss, and Hope in an African Slum</h2><p><p><em>Find Me Unafraid </em>tells the uncommon love story between two uncommon people whose collaboration sparked a successful movement to transform the lives of vulnerable girls and the urban poor. With a Foreword by Nicholas Kristof.</p><p>This is the story of two young people from completely different worlds: Kennedy Odede from Kibera, the largest slum in Africa, and Jessica Posner from Denver, Colorado.&nbsp; Kennedy foraged for food, lived on the street, and taught himself to read with old newspapers. When an American volunteer gave him the work of Mandela, Garvey, and King, teenaged Kennedy decided he was going to change his life and his community. He bought a soccer ball and started a youth empowerment group he called Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO). Then in 2007, Wesleyan undergraduate Jessica Posner spent a semester abroad in Kenya working with SHOFCO. Breaking all convention, she decided to live in Kibera with Kennedy, and they fell in love.Their connection persisted, and Jessica helped Kennedy to escape political violence and fulfill his lifelong dream of an education, at Wesleyan University.</p><p>The alchemy of their remarkable union has drawn the support of community members and celebrities alike&#x2014;The Clintons, Mia Farrow, and Nicholas Kristof are among their fans&#x2014;and their work has changed the lives of many of Kibera&#x2019;s most vulnerable population: its girls. Jess and Kennedy founded Kibera&#x2019;s first tuition-free school for girls, a large, bright blue building, which stands as a bastion of hope in what once felt like a hopeless place. But Jessica and Kennedy are just getting started&#x2014;they have expanded their model to connect essential services like health care, clean water, and economic empowerment programs. They&#x2019;ve opened an identical project in Mathare, Kenya&#x2019;s second largest slum, and intend to expand their remarkably successful program for change.</p><p>Ultimately this is a love story about a fight against poverty and hopelessness, the transformation made possible by a true love, and the power of young people to have a deep impact on the world.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>The inspiring true story of how one couple&#x2019;s love changed a community</p><p>Growing up homeless in Kibera, a slum in Kenya, Kennedy Odede received a book of Martin Luther King&#x2019;s speeches that changed his life and inspired him to start Shining Hope for Communities, a local youth group. Several years later, irrepressible Wesleyan student Jessica Posner traveled to Kenya to work with SHOFCO. Soon, she and Kennedy fell in love. After returning to Wesleyan, Jessica discovered that Kennedy was threatened by political violence. She helped him escape by convincing Wesleyan&#x2019;s admissions committee to offer him a full scholarship. </p><p>Once they&#x2019;d finished college, Kennedy and Jessica returned to Kibera to found a school for hundreds of its most vulnerable residents: girls. They later opened a sister school in another slum, Mathare. With help from the community and donors around the world, they also provide water, health care, and entrepreneurial programs to tens of thousands in both places, and are determined to improve the lives of countless more. </p><p>Tender and inspiring, <em>Find Me Unafraid</em> vividly illustrates the power we all have to impact the world, and stands as a testament to the transformations made possible by true love.</p><p>Kennedy Odede is one of Africa's best-known community organizers and social entrepreneurs. Kennedy is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and a trustee of Wesleyan University.</p><br><br><p>Jessica Posner is the cofounder of Shining Hope for Communities. She is a nationally recognized social entrepreneur and activist. She won the 2010 Do Something Award and was named "America's top world-changer 25 and under" live on VH1.

In <i>Those Who Work, Those Who Don't</i>, Jennifer Sherman offers a much-needed sympathetic understanding of poor rural Americans, persuasively arguing that the growing cultural significance of moral values is a reasonable and inevitable response to economic collapse and political powerlessness.</p><p><i>Those Who Work, Those Who Don't</i> is based on the intimate interviews and in-depth research Sherman conducted while spending a year living in "Golden Valley," a remote logging town in Northern California. Economically devastated by the 1990 ruling that listed the northern spotted owl as a threatened species, Golden Valley proved to be a rich case study for Sherman. She looks at how the members of the community coped with downward mobility caused by the loss of timber industry jobs and examines a wide range of reactions. She shows how substance abuse, domestic violence, and gender roles fluctuated under the town's economic strain.</p><p>Compellingly written, shot through with honesty and empathy, <i>Those Who Work, Those Who Don't</i> is a rare firsthand account that studies the rural poor. As incomes erode and the American dream becomes more and more inaccessible, Sherman reveals that moral values and practices become a way for the poor to gain status and maintain a sense of dignity in the face of economic ruin.</p></p><p>Jennifer Sherman is assistant professor of sociology at Washington State University.</p><h2>Galapagos Islands : Explorer (Ocean Explorer Maps)</h2><p>The young, volcanic, Galapagos Archipelago is made up of over 130 islands and islets, although only five are actually inhabited. A province of Ecuador, they are located on the Equator, about 1,000 km (about 600 miles) to the west of South American mainland. Aside from their natural beauty, and the opportunities for exploration by sea, the Galapagos Islands are intimately associated with scientific research. While this may have begun with Charles Darwin&#39;s brief visit in 1835, today the emphasis is on conservation research, and the islands and surrounding marine reserve form a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. This title features: illustrated biographies of explorers and other notable people; historical time line; color photos and text on Galapagos wildlife, and basic information on evolution, endemic species, conservation, and more; information about all the main islands, visitor sites, and most popular dive sites. &#34;The Galapagos Islands Explorer&#34; also has sections on human history, conservation, National Park Rules, the various island names (Ecuadorian and English), a timeline, and biographies of the significant people in Galapagos history. It will complement a trip to the islands, and help you make the most of your time there. Mapping has come a long way since the islands first appeared on Gerardus Mercator&#39;s map in 1569, and the &#34;Galapagos Islands Explorer&#34; is the perfect companion for a visit to the archipelago. As well as the map itself, the Explorer gives a general introduction to the geology, climate, and geography of the islands, plus background background information on the flora and fauna you can expect to see - from Galapagos cotton to the famous iguanas and giant tortoises. There is concise and practical information on each of the main islands as well as the most popular dive sites.</p><p></p><h2>All She Ever Wanted: (A Contemporary Women&#39;s Fiction Family Drama)</h2><p>All She Ever Wanted is the emotionpacked story of three generations of women: Kathleen, her mother, Eleanor, and her grandmother, Fiona. Each woman left home to escape her family&#39;s past and to start a new life. Kathleen has been estranged from her family for 35 years, and she is torn between the need to forgive and the urge to forget. Hoping to find answers that will patch the wounds of her tattered heart and salvage her relationship with her daughter, Kathleen embarks on a journey into her family&#39;s mysterious past.</p><p>Lynn Austin is a former teacher who now writes and speaks full time. She has won three Christy Awards for her historical novels Candle in the Darkness, Fire by Night, and Hidden Places. She and her husband have three children and make their home near Chicago, Illinois.One of Christian fiction's favorite authors pens an engaging story about family secrets that begins powerfully, but eventually loses steam. Kathleen Seymour's carefully constructed world starts to collapse when her teenage daughter, Joelle, is caught shoplifting and a row with her boss leaves Kathleen unemployed. After a few sessions with a therapist, Kathleen tries reconnecting with her daughter by taking her to a party hosted by the estranged family members Kathleen left years ago. Through multiple points of view and rich, detailed flashbacks to previous generations, Austin convincingly illustrates how shame and bad choices can affect families for years. The fairy-tale ending is less convincing, as it's replete with former delinquents spouting pat phrases; it's also implausible that painful relationships between family members are easily repaired with a single trip back home. But the three-time Christy Award winner offers the surprising plot twists and fresh language that keep her fans coming back to the bookstores for each new novel. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A professor at Bowdoin College, Chamberlain volunteered for service in the Union army in 1862 but declined the colonelcy of a regiment, "preferring to start a little lower and learn the business first." Chamberlain also took part in many other important battles, including Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Petersburg, during which he received his fourth serious wound of the war. He later took part in the Appomattox Campaign, and commanded the troops that formally accepted the surrender of the Confederate army. Following his military service, he served as governor of Maine and president of Bowdoin College.INTRODUCTORY<br> &nbsp;<br> HISTORY is written for the most part from the outside. Truth often suffers distortion by reason of the point of view of the narrator, some pre-occupation of his judgment or fancy not only as to relative merits but even as to facts in their real relations. An interior view may not be without some personal coloring. But it must be of interest, especially in important transactions, to know how things appeared to those actually engaged in them. Action and passion on such a scale must bear some thoughts &#x201c;that run before and after.&#x201d; It has been deemed a useful observance &#x201c;to see ourselves as others see us,&#x201d; but it may sometimes be conducive to a just comprehension of the truth to let others see us as we see ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> The view here presented is of things as they appeared to us who were concerned with them as subordinate commanders,&#x2014;having knowledge, however, of the general plan, and a share in the responsibility for its execution. This is a chapter of experiences,&#x2014;including in this term not only what was done, but what was known and said and thought and felt,&#x2014;not to say, suffered; and in its darkest passages showing a steadfast purpose, patience, and spirit of obedience deserving of record even if too often without recompense, until the momentous consummation.<br> &nbsp;<br> These memoirs are based on notes made nearly at the time of the events which they describe. They give what may be called an interior view of occurrences on the front of the Fifth Corps, Army of the Potomac, during the last essay in Grant&#x2019;s Virginia campaign. This was so distinctive in character, conditions, and consequences, that I have ventured to entitle it &#x201c;The Last Campaign of the Armies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I trust this narrative may not seem to arrogate too much for the merits of the Fifth Corps. No eminence is claimed for it beyond others in that campaign. But the circumstance that this Corps was assigned to an active part with Sheridan during the period chiefly in view&#x2014;the envelopment and final out-flanking of Lee&#x2019;s army&#x2014;warrants the prominence given in this review.<br> &nbsp;<br> It may be permitted to hope that this simple recital may throw some light on a passage of the history of this Corps, the record of which has been obscured in consequence of the summary change of commanders early in the campaign.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Fifth Corps had a certain severity of reputation quite distinctive in the comradeship of the army. Early in its history, Porter&#x2019;s Division&#x2014;the nucleus of it&#x2014;had drawn the especial praise of General McClellan for its soldierly bearing and proficiency, being unfortunately referred to in orders as a model for the rest of the army. This had the effect of creating on the part of others a feeling of jealousy towards that Division or an opposition to apparent favoritism shown its commander, which was extended to the whole Corps on its formation in the summer of 1862, when the Regulars were assigned to it as its Second Division, and the choice Pennsylvania Reserves became its Third Division. This feeling certainly was neither caused nor followed by anything like boastfulness or selfcomplacency on the part of the Fifth Corps; but, if anything, created a sense of responsibility and willingness to &#x201c;endure hardness as good soldiers&#x201d; to make good their reputation. And no doubt the discipline of the Corps was quite severe. Most of its commanding officers in the superior grades were West Pointers, and experienced officers of the old army, and prided themselves on strict observance of Army Regulations and military habitudes. The required personal relations between officers and men were quite novel and but slowly acquiesced in by volunteers who were first-class citizens at home,&#x2014;many of them equal to their official &#x201c;superiors.&#x201d; For example: my young brother, Tom, when a private in my regiment came sometimes to see me in my tent, but would not think of sitting down in my presence unless specially invited to do so. But he went home from Appomattox Lieutenant-Colonel of his regiment and Brevet-Colonel of United States Volunteers&#x2014;and this on his own merits, not through any suggestion of mine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Passages in the history of the Corps had endeared its members to each other, and brought out soldierly pride and manly character; but boastful assertion and just glorification of their Corps were remarkably less manifest among its members than with those of every one of the other splendid Corps of the Army of the Potomac.<br> &nbsp;<br> It may not be improper to state here that there was a manifest prejudice against the Fifth Corps at Government Headquarters,&#x2014;particularly at Stanton&#x2019;s,&#x2014;on account of the supposed attachment for McClellan and Porter among its members. This was believed to be the reason why no promotion to the rank of General Officers was made in this Corps for a long time, unless secured by political influence. Brigades and even divisions were in many cases commanded by colonels of State regiments. This worked a great injustice in the fact that officers of similar commands in the different Corps were not of similar relative rank, and some were therefore unduly subordinated to those who were not in fact their superiors in service. There was also a practical injustice in the added expense of supporting headquarters above lineal rank, which, with no extra pay or allowance, quite cancelled the compliment.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had not been the habit in the Fifth Corps to encourage detailed reports on the part of subordinates, and in the rush and pressure of this last campaign there was less opportunity or care than ever for such matters, and the impressiveness of its momentous close left little disposition to multiply words upon subordinate parts or participants. The fact also of an early and sudden change in the grand tactics of the campaign confused the significance and sometimes the identity of important movements; and the change of commanders in the crisis of its most important battle induced consequences which, even in official reports and testimony afterwards called for, affected the motive in sharply defining actions where personal concern had come to be an embarrassing factor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Very naturally, the immediate reports of those days are meager in the extreme; and very much of what has come out since, partaking of official character, has been under the disadvantage of being elicited as ex parte testimony before military tribunals where the highest military officers of the Government were parties, and the attitudes of plaintiff and defendant almost inevitably biased expression.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the strange lull after the surrender of Lee and the sudden release from intense action and responsibility, but as yet in the field and in the active habit not readily relinquished, it occurred to me, impressed with the deep-wrought visions of those tragic days, to write down, while fresh in mind and mood, some salient facts of that last campaign, within my personal knowledge and observation, to serve for fireside memories in after years, and for the satisfaction of some others who had given of their best for the great issues in which these scenes were involved.<br> &nbsp;<br> It has been suggested to me of late that these reminiscences might be of interest to a wider circle whose hearts respond to the story of things done and suffered for truth and honor&#x2019;s sake, which they would have gladly shared in their own persons. In preparing for this more exacting demand I have availed myself of additional material which, in the later consolidations in the Fifth Corps, successive assignments brought into my hands: particularly the office-copy of the Corps field-orders for the last campaign, and also the invaluable original records of the Medical Inspector of the Corps for that period. Later, came the (now suppressed) volumes of the records of the Warren Court of Inquiry, and the extensive Records of the War of the Rebellion. In revising this personal memoir, I have diligently consulted these, but have found no occasion to correct or modify the account given from my own point of view, however limited. Qualifying or corroborative testimony from these sources, when introduced, has been clearly indicated.<br> &nbsp;<br> I confess some embarrassments of a personal nature in giving forth certain passages of this record. These facts, however simply stated, cannot but have some bearing on points which have been drawn into controversy on the part of persons who were dear to me as commanders and companions in arms, and who have grown still dearer in the intimacies of friendship since the war. Alas! that no one of them can answer my greeting across the bar. I feel therefore under increased responsibility in recounting these things, but assure myself that I know of no demand of personality or partisanship which should make me doubtful of my ability to tell the truth as I saw and knew it, or distrust my judgment in forming an opinion.<br> &nbsp;<br> J.L.C.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Turn for the Bad (A County Cork Mystery)</h2><p><b>The<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>An Early Wake</i> returns to Ireland where Sullivan&#x2019;s Pub owner Maura Donovan gets mixed up with smugglers.</b><br><br>After calling Ireland home for six months, Boston expat Maura Donovan still has a lot to learn about Irish ways&#x2014;and Sullivan&#x2019;s Pub is her classroom.

The few customers in the pub, local men and regulars, didn&#x2019;t seem to know what the latest arrival was talking about.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re yeh sayin&#x2019;?&#x201d; one of them asked.</p><p>&#x201c;John Tully,&#x201d; the newcomer said, still out of breath. &#x201c;Went out this mornin&#x2019; with his boy to take a walk on the shore, he told his wife. He hasn&#x2019;t come back. No one&#x2019;s seen him since. His brother went out to look fer him, found the boy wanderin&#x2019; on the beach. His wife&#x2019;s beside herself with worry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s bad,&#x201d; another man said. &#x201c;After that other thing and all.&#x201d;</p><p>Maura was falling more and more behind in this conversation. If she&#x2019;d got it right, not only had this Tully man disappeared, leaving a young child alone on the beach, but it had happened before? To Tully or to someone else? Nearby or somewhere else? She hadn&#x2019;t heard anything about that, but for all she knew the first disappearance had happened a century earlier. She had learned that memories were long in this part of Ireland. &#x201c;Is he from around here?&#x201d; she ventured.</p><p>The first man turned to her. &#x201c;Over toward Dromadoon. Sorry, we&#x2019;ve not met. I&#x2019;m Richard McCarthy, and you&#x2019;d be Maura Donovan? Used to be I&#x2019;d stop by now and then when Old Mick ran the place, but not lately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; Maura said, &#x201c;and welcome back to Sullivan&#x2019;s. So what&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;John Tully, a good man, told his wife, Nuala, he wanted some air before the evenin&#x2019; milkin&#x2019;. She told him to bring along the youngest child, Eoin, because she was takin&#x2019; the older ones to something or other. He did so. Nuala came back a few hours later, and there was no sign of man. It was gettin&#x2019; cold and she was worried about the little one, so she sent the brother Conor out to collect him. Conor comes back with the child, but not John. It isn&#x2019;t like John to go missin&#x2019; like that. So she waited fer a bit, then went over to where John liked to walk. He had what he called a &#x2018;thinking rock&#x2019; by the water, and she knew where to look. No sign of him there. She had the other kids with her, and Conor as well, so they all searched and they found nothing. Then she called the garda�, and they&#x2019;re searching now.&#x201d; The man settled himself on a stool at the bar, and a couple of the other men took adjoining seats. &#x201c;I could do with a pint, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Rose?&#x201d; Maura nodded toward Rose Sweeney, who worked in the pub part of the time, as did her father, Jimmy, who&#x2019;d been listening to the tale.</p><p>&#x201c;Right away,&#x201d; Rose said. &#x201c;Anyone else?&#x201d; Rose glanced around the room.</p><p>One of the other men at the bar nodded, and Rose started two pints.</p><p>Maura turned back to the men at the bar. &#x201c;You said this has happened before? I mean, someone just disappearing?&#x201d;</p><p>Richard McCarthy nodded, his expression somber. &#x201c;Terrible thing, that was. Before your time, I&#x2019;m guessin&#x2019;, a year or two back. Older man, a farmer, married a young American who was visiting here, and they had a child, a little girl it was. Light of his life, he said. But the wife was talking about moving back to the States and takin&#x2019; the child with her. So the man went out with the girl while the wife was visitin&#x2019; a friend, and drowned the little one and then himself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How awful!&#x201d; Maura said. &#x201c;Do you think John Tully&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Maura wasn&#x2019;t sure how to finish her question. She didn&#x2019;t know the man, but she couldn&#x2019;t believe he would have taken his young child along if he planned to drown himself.</p><p>&#x201c;God willing, I hope not. Nor is there any reason to suspect it. John&#x2019;s a good man, and he and his wife get on well. He&#x2019;d have no reason to do himself harm. And he loves the boy&#x2014;the first son, after three girls.&#x201d;</p><p>Rose slid the pints across the bar to the waiting men. &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s looking fer him now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The neighbors and the garda�. The wife&#x2019;s waitin&#x2019; back home with the kids&#x2014;she had the milkin&#x2019; to do. The garda� haven&#x2019;t called the coast guard yet, seein&#x2019; as there&#x2019;s no reason to think he was out on the water. John has no boat and wasn&#x2019;t much of a man fer the boatin&#x2019;, him raisin&#x2019; cows and all. But he liked the walk&#x2014;said it was good for his thinkin&#x2019;. Ta.&#x201d; He raised his glass to Maura. She realized she probably was expected not to charge him for it since he was the bearer of news, even if the news was bad. Another thing she was getting used to: the odd rules about who paid and when at the pub.</p><p>&#x201c;Will they be needin&#x2019; help?&#x201d; one of the other men asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Might do. It&#x2019;ll be gettin&#x2019; dark soon. No doubt the garda� will get the word out if it&#x2019;s wanted. And some of you must be volunteers for the coast guard, eh?&#x201d; McCarthy had finished his pint quickly, draining the last of it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m off to tell the folk at Sheahan&#x2019;s across the street. Pray fer the man, will yeh?&#x201d;</p><p>After McCarthy had left, the remaining men lapsed into glum silence. Maura checked the time: only a couple of hours until dusk, now that it was late October. Would that be enough time to search? She could understand how a man could walk out of his home and just keep going, but to take a small child along and then abandon him? That made no sense.</p><p>&#x201c;Rose, I&#x2019;m going to talk with Billy for a bit, okay?&#x201d; Maura said.</p><p>&#x201c;No worries. I think I can handle the crowd here,&#x201d; Rose replied, dimpling. By Maura&#x2019;s count there were five customers in the room, including Old Billy, who lived in a couple of rooms at the far end of the building that Maura now owned and who spent most of his waking time holding court in the pub, seated by the fire. She guessed he was well past eighty, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure even he knew his age. He had known Maura&#x2019;s predecessor Old Mick well, and luckily Billy Sheahan had stayed around to see Maura through the first few rocky months. And since he had lived in the area all of his eighty-plus years, he knew the history of most people and places in West Cork.</p><p>Maura walked over to the corner by the fire, where Billy occupied his favorite armchair&#x2014;which no one else who knew the place dared to sit in&#x2014;and sat down in the adjoining chair. &#x201c;Are you ready for another pint, Billy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet, thanks fer askin&#x2019;. McCarthy&#x2019;s news has put me right off my drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t sound good. Do you know the Tully family?&#x201d; Maura asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew John&#x2019;s grandfather, years ago. They&#x2019;ve a nice little piece of land over west of here, and they keep cows. The make a fair living at it, from what I hear.&#x201d;</p><p>Maura thought a moment. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying John Tully would have no reason to, well, do himself harm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not likely. And he and his wife are well suited, and they grew up together. And then there&#x2019;s the child. The man was over the moon about havin&#x2019; a son at last, after the three girls.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I was thinking&#x2014;he wouldn&#x2019;t have just gone off and left the kid. So if John didn&#x2019;t have any problems, where is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That I cannot say,&#x201d; Billy replied somberly.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the coast guard like around here? I haven&#x2019;t heard much about them. Well, except when a fishing boat goes missing or starts to sink.&#x201d;</p><p>Billy smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give yeh the short course, shall I? The Irish Coast Guard is a national organization that rescues people from danger at sea or on land, and that includes the cliffs and the beaches. There are three rescue centers, and the closest is on Valentia Island, over to Kerry. The Volunteer Coastal Units can do search and rescue&#x2014;the nearest ones are at Glandore, and no doubt you&#x2019;ve been past that one, and Toe Head. They&#x2019;d be the ones would be called in fer this. They&#x2019;re volunteers, local men and women alike, who have to live within ten minutes of the station&#x2014;which clearly we here in Leap do&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re always on call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never knew any of that, Billy,&#x201d; Maura said. &#x201c;How come you know so much about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of me nephews has been a volunteer fer years. But he&#x2019;s seldom called in. Still, there are always those daft tourists who think climbing a cliff is a fine idea, until they get into trouble and they have to be rescued.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Richard McCarthy didn&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d been called yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew the beach Tully likes, years ago, and I doubt it&#x2019;s changed much. If the man isn&#x2019;t found there, the rescue teams will be called in soon enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was the coast guard part of that other story?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where the little girl was drowned? They were, as were the garda� and the local firemen. But neither father nor daughter was found until the next day. The man left a note behind, although it took them a bit to find it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And no one saw them go into the water?&#x201d; Maura asked.</p><p>Billy looked at her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve not spent much time along the beaches here, have you, now? There&#x2019;s few people near enough to see anything, if they&#x2019;re not lookin&#x2019; fer it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had the time, I guess, and I don&#x2019;t much like just going for walks. Down along the harbor here now and then, but that&#x2019;s about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you not grow up near the sea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes and no. Boston&#x2019;s got a harbor, and there&#x2019;s plenty of coastline nearby, but I never had the time to go off and look at the water and play in the sand. I was usually working at one job or another, when I wasn&#x2019;t in school.&#x201d; There had always been a job, because she and her gran had never had enough money.</p><p>&#x201c;Do yeh know how to swim?&#x201d; Billy asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Enough to stay afloat, Billy. My high school got some kind of special grant to give the kids swimming lessons. That&#x2019;s about it. Doesn&#x2019;t mean I like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s many a fisherman hereabouts who can&#x2019;t swim, so yer ahead of the game there.&#x201d; The front door opened, and Billy nodded toward the newcomers. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve business to tend to. Maybe there&#x2019;s someone who&#x2019;s had some good news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope so, Billy.&#x201d; Maura went back to her usual place behind the bar and started helping Rose pull pints for the newcomers. It didn&#x2019;t surprise her that the crowd grew throughout the evening, everyone hoping to hear that John Tully had been found. Most of the people who came in knew him, or had bought cows or milk from him, or were related to his mother&#x2019;s cousin over near Clonakilty, and so on. Maura had given up trying to sort out all the invisible connections that existed in this part of Ireland, or maybe throughout the entire country&#x2014;she hadn&#x2019;t had time to check out more than this small corner.</p><p>Mick Nolan, the final member of Maura&#x2019;s staff, had arrived around five and kept busy since. Maura hadn&#x2019;t had time to ask if he had come out of concern for John Tully or because he had heard the news and guessed that it would be a busy night at the pub. As the night wore on, Maura noticed a current of anxiety running through the crowd. No one was drinking much, and Maura hadn&#x2019;t the heart to insist that they keep buying pints. Mostly the people there wanted to be together, either to wait for whatever news came or to share the outcome, good or bad.</p><p>It was past ten when garda Sean Murphy walked in. Conversation in the pub came to a halt, and all eyes turned toward Sean. He came straight to the point.</p><p>&#x201c;No sign of the man. They&#x2019;ve called off the search until first light.&#x201d;</p><p>The mood in the room ratcheted down a notch, and people started draining their glasses and heading for the door: there would be no more news this night. Sean made his way to the bar.</p><p>&#x201c;A pint or coffee?&#x201d; Maura asked.</p><p>Sean rubbed his face. He looked tired, despite the fact that he was younger than Maura&#x2019;s twenty-five years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love a pint, but it&#x2019;ll be an early day tomorrow. Coffee, if you will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coming up,&#x201d; Maura said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it,&#x201d; Rose volunteered. Maura hadn&#x2019;t even noticed she was still there, they&#x2019;d been so busy. Rose usually left early in the evening, except weekends, but most likely she had been as anxious as the rest of the people to hear what was going on.</p><p>Maura leaned on the counter to ask Sean, &#x201c;What can you tell me?&#x201d;</p><p>Sean shook his head. &#x201c;Too little. Everyone&#x2019;s been out hunting half the day, since we heard. The mother&#x2019;s been hovering at the scene, with some of her family around her. The children are staying with the rest of &#x2019;em.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you find the boy? You must have gone over that beach with a fine-tooth comb. Did you find anything useful?&#x201d; Maura asked, although she wasn&#x2019;t sure what that might be.</p><p>Sean glanced around, but no one was near enough to overhear their quiet conversation. &#x201c;We found some footprints where Conor told us to look&#x2014;large and small, together. But they were soon trampled by well-meaning people lookin&#x2019; fer the man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard it was John&#x2019;s brother who found the boy and took him home,&#x201d; Maura said. &#x201c;Is he old enough to tell you anything?&#x201d;</p><p>Sean shrugged. &#x201c;Hard to say. He&#x2019;s only just turned three, and his mother&#x2019;s barely let him get a word out since he&#x2019;s come home. What he&#x2019;ll remember in the morning is anyone&#x2019;s guess. The best we got was that he kept talkin&#x2019; about a boat. No surprise, seein&#x2019; as how he was on the beach.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he seem upset? Did he mention his dad?&#x201d; If the boy had seen a fight, what would he have made of it?</p><p>Sean almost smiled. &#x201c;Maura, have I not just told you we don&#x2019;t know the details yet? We&#x2019;ll sort it out in the morning. The poor lad was exhausted, as was his mother. We&#x2019;ll all have fresher eyes tomorrow.&#x201d; He drained his cup quickly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better be on my way so I can get an early start. I only wanted to make sure you knew the story so far, and the others here, so they could spread the word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Sean. I appreciate it,&#x201d; Maura said softly. Maura wasn&#x2019;t quite sure whether he had been thinking of her concern or only wanted to get the word out as quickly as possible&#x2014;and what better way than to tell a pub full of worried people? &#x201c;Safe home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And to you,&#x201d; Sean said, then gathered himself up and went out the door.</p><p>The crowd cleared quickly after that, and by midnight only Maura and Mick remained, clearing up the last of the glasses scattered around the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Mick, are you planning to stop by your grandmother&#x2019;s tomorrow?&#x201d; Maura asked, washing the final glasses.</p><p>&#x201c;I might do,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could you stop by my house? I&#x2019;ve got a small problem and I&#x2019;m not sure what to do.&#x201d; She hated to ask anyone for help, much less someone she worked with, but there were things she was clueless about, and how to manage an old stone cottage in this part of the world was one of them. She needed someone who knew how things worked, and she knew Mick was often down the lane visiting...</p></p><h2>All Fired Up (Road to Love, 3)</h2><p><strong>He&#x2019;s tantalizing trouble she can&#x2019;t resist...</strong><br><br>Charlotte Parrish has always wanted a certain kind of man: someone responsible, settled, <em>boring</em>.

Personally, I've raised two successful men that have given me four beautiful grandchildren, all currently under the age of six. Resources like Phase weren't readily available at my fingertips while raising my children, so like a lot of parents, I did the best I could on my own with a lot of trial and error and certainly by the grace of God. I was so pleasantly surprised with the gift I had discovered in these books that I couldn't wait to share the information with my children and grandchildren .... My granddaughter will enter kindergarten this year and these books will be such guideposts for me as well as her parents for many years to come.

In <i>Flatlining</i>, Adia Harvey Wingfield exposes how hospitals, clinics, and other institutions participate in &#x201c;racial outsourcing,&#x201d; relying heavily on black doctors, nurses, technicians, and physician assistants to do &#x201c;equity work&#x201d;&#x2014;extra labor that makes organizations and their services more accessible to communities of color. Wingfield argues that as these organizations become more profit driven, they come to depend on black health care professionals to perform equity work to serve increasingly diverse constituencies. Yet black workers often do this labor without recognition, compensation, or support. Operating at the intersection of work, race, gender, and class, Wingfield makes plain the challenges that black employees must overcome and reveals the complicated issues of inequality in today&#x2019;s workplaces and communities.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Flatlining</i> advances our understanding of race in the U.S. workplace and is a must-read for anyone who seeks to comprehend the economic and social realities facing African Americans in hospital settings today. Adia Harvey Wingfield&#x2019;s investigation into how black professionals in the healthcare sector experience racial outsourcing shows the limitations among far too many organizations in how they think about diversity, equity, and inclusion. Her interview-based evidence leads to the conclusion that to meet the needs of the diverse communities who rely on their products and services, organizations need to start by intentionally focusing on creating a racially diverse and inclusive workplace.&#x201d;&#x2014;Heather Boushey, Executive Director, Washington Center for Equitable Growth<br><br> &#x201c;I know of no other book that so clearly explains how race, class, and gender shape the experiences of black professionals.&#x201d;&#x2014;Christine L. Williams, author of <i>Inside Toyland: Working, Shopping, and Social Inequality</i><br><br> &#x201c;Wingfield demonstrates how the focus of workplace racial interactions should be shifted to include not only what is done <i>to</i> black employees but also the work that is done <i>through</i> them. This should be reviewed by anyone at the management level, regardless of the business sector.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marcus H.

Snell describes the age-old practice of turning wildflowers and garden plants into balms and remedies for such ailments and injuries as snakebite, headache, leg cramps, swollen joints, asthma, and sores. She brings to bear not only her lifetime of experience but also the invaluable lessons of her grandmother, the legendary medicine woman Pretty Shield.&nbsp;With life-enhancing recipes for everything from soups, teas, and breads to poultices, aphrodisiacs, and fertility aids, <i>A Taste of Heritage</i> is above all a fascinating cultural document certain to enrich the reader&#x2019;s relationship with the natural world.<b></b>&nbsp;<b>A partial list of recipes:</b>&nbsp;Wild Bitterroot SauceWild Carrot PuddingCattail BiscuitsDandelion SoupSalsify Oyster StewBalapia (Berry Pudding)Juneberry PieChokecherry CakeWild Mint TeaBitterberry LemonadeWheel BreadBoiled HoovesBill&#x2019;s Mother&#x2019;s Antelope RoastStuffed TroutElk RoastStuffed EggsOld-Time Moose RoastWild Turnip PorridgeWild Turnip BreadFresh Wild SaladBuffalo Cattail StewGround Tomato SaladGooseberry PuddingBearberry ButterSpicy Dried Plum CakeBuffaloberry Jelly</p><p>Alma Hogan Snell&nbsp;(1923&#x2013;2008) is the granddaughter of the famed Crow medicine woman Pretty Shield, on whose life the classic <i>Pretty-shield</i> is based. She is the author of <i>Grandmother&#x2019;s Grandchild: My Crow Indian Life</i>, available in a Bison Books edition. &nbsp;Lisa Castle is a graduate student in biology at the University of Kansas. &nbsp;Kelly Kindscher is an associate scientist at the Kansas Biological Survey and the author of <i>Medicinal Wild Plants of the Prairie: An Ethnobotanical Guide</i>.<p></p>This curious, absorbing volume reads more like a textbook on ancient Crow foodways and less like a traditional cookbook or self-help guide, although it includes tasty recipes for American Indian dishes like Plum Bread and Cornmeal Flapjacks, as well as remedies for snakebite and less dramatic afflictions. The author, the granddaughter of a famed Crow medicine woman, initiates with authority those who may be unfamiliar with various dishes and techniques, patiently explaining that "beaver tail is good tasting, chewy, and rich," and that the dried lungs of a buffalo make for a good jerky-style snack. She recommends cooking a moose all day, preferably in a pit in the ground and suggests that, for the most tender rabbit, only flouring and frying will do. As for the medicinal properties of different herbs, bear root helps with midwifery, and stinging nettles can be brewed into a tea that helps cure allergies. Even if one doesn't have bear root or nettles growing in the yard, this book is a valuable investigation of the variety and utility of nature, bringing ancient Crow traditions to life.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Assembled in <i>Signposts in a Strange Land</i>, these essays on language, literature, philosophy, religion, psychiatry, morality, and life and letters in the South display the imaginative versatility of an author considered by many to be one the greatest modern American writers.</p></p><p><p><b>Walker Percy </b>wrote several books, many of them bestsellers, and is considered one of the greatest American writers of our time.</p>A pungent, revealing collection of lectures, essays, and interviews--some previously published in Harper's, The Georgia Review, etc.--by the late novelist (d. 1990). Percy was a quintessentially American writer with a voice of his own that was never compromised. His observation that the purpose of the novel is to give pleasure can be applied to this work as well. The nonfiction has a droll, dry, carefully laid-back honesty that shares something important with such masters of American English as Russell Baker, James Thurber, and Mark Twain; but Percy can also be as intense as Graham Greene in the earnestness of his Catholicism. He wrote novels with plenty of thought-content, and his nonfiction has plenty of storytelling. He writes about science, linguistics, literature, and the South, in ascending order of success, and while he is no threat to Chomsky and his successors, his essay on bourbon puts him up there with Flann O'Brien on the subject of whiskey. The title of his 1957 essay ``The Coming Crisis in Psychiatry'' is prescient, as are his queries into a profession that has since splintered in all directions. This is diligent, unassuming writing, always as clear and simple as the subject will allow, and sometimes deadly. It does not have the brooding elegance of his best fiction, but it has a stubborn integrity and a sense of the future. Always, Percy strives to keep in balance a very real spiritual talent, the abstract theories of science in which he was trained (as a doctor), and the precise, forgiving sense of human frailty in which the best southern writing is grounded. Percy was that rarest of creatures, an educated gentleman, a true man of the humanities; like the bourbon he writes about, he has a complex, heady flavor all his own. A good book to travel with. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The reason is that all of God&#x2019;s precepts, prohibitions, and punishments are aimed at promoting the good of the whole universe and, more particularly, the good for human beings, both individually and within the various forms of social life. Because of this, law serves as both a restraint on bad actions and a spur to good action, i.e., a restraint on actions that take us away from virtue and genuine human flourishing and a spur to actions that promote virtue and flourishing.</p><p> There are many benefits of having the whole treatise rather than just the first few questions, as has been the standard practice in previous editions of the Treatise on Law. To mention just a few of these benefits, the question on the moral precepts of the Old Law (question 100) helps to illuminate in many different ways the earlier questions on natural law and human law (questions 94&#x2013;97). Again, the questions on the ceremonial and judicial precepts of the Old Law (questions 101&#x2013;105) demon-strate in depth the symbiotic relationship that St. Thomas takes to obtain between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The questions on the New Law provide an introduction to the Christian way of life that will be described in incomparable detail in the Second Part of the Second Part, the bulk of which is structured around the treatment of the three theological virtues and the four cardinal virtues.</p></p><p>Professor Freddoso has achieved a most remarkable accomplishment: he has made the Angelic Doctor&#x2019;s <i>Treatise on Law</i> (in its full complement!) accessible to the contemporary reader! Bravo! As I read his translation, I realized that I was reading as if Saint Thomas were speaking to me the wisdom of the ages regarding God&#x2019;s law and how humanity has appropriated it through the natural law. Needless to say, the Freddoso translation will serve as a great tool for teachers, scholars, students, and anyone else who may be interested in better understanding the authentic nature of law. Moreover, the accompanying index &#x2013; a first, I believe &#x2013; will assist all readers to identify more readily the thinking of Thomas&#x2019;s that undergirds his thought on the law and its meaning! Bravo, again! This reader awaits with eagerness more of the Freddoso translation of the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>!Here for the first time is the complete Treatise on Law, marvelously Englished by Fred Freddoso, a foretaste of his translation of the whole <i>Summa Theologiae</i>. Future discussions of Thomas on law will wisely rely on this presentation. --Ralph McInerny, Michael P. Grace Professor of Philosophy, Ralph McInerny, Michael P.

Or received one in the mail?<br><br>These days, it&#x2019;s so easy to dash off a quick e-mail or text message or make a cell- phone call while you&#x2019;re on the run that you may rarely make time for letter writing. But letters are a time-honored form of connection that simply cannot be equaled or replaced by faster methods of communication. <br><i><br>The Art of the Personal Letter</i> reclaims this lost art, giving you the gift of leisurely expression and allowing you to write beautiful, enduring letters to the people you care about&#x2014;be it by hand or on a computer. For any occasion&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re reaching out to connect with a long-lost friend or you want to express condolences with grace&#x2014;author Margaret Shepherd gives you both the inspiration and the tools to write a memorable and meaningful letter that will be cherished by its recipient for years.<br><br>Filled with marvelous examples of common types of letters, <i>The Art of the Personal Letter </i>provides helpful guidelines to enhance your unique voice and inspire you to start that holiday letter or difficult letter of apology. From choosing just the right words, the right stationery, and even the right pen or font, you&#x2019;ll learn everything you need to know about the timeless art of the personal letter.</p></p><p><p>Margaret Shepherd is a noted calligrapher and author whose clients include numerous headliners. The author of thousands of personal letters and fourteen hand-lettered instructional books on calligraphy, including the bestselling <i>Learning Calligraphy</i>, she has exhibited her work in many museums and galleries. She lives in Boston.<br><br>Sharon Cloud Hogan has written and edited several books for general readers&nbsp;. She leads workshops on nonfiction writing for physicians, and she is a manuscript editor at <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.&nbsp; She lives near Boston.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>The Art of Connecting</p><p>What a lot we lost when we stopped writing letters! </p><p>You can't reread a phone call.</p><p>&#x2014;Liz Carpenter<br></p><p>You're so connected. You check your messages from a gizmo in your pocket, a laptop on your kitchen table, and a desktop in your office. You read e-mail from work while you are at home and personal e-mail on the job. You send out jokes, photos, breaking news, invitations, and announcements. You phone people between classes, on the train, and before a concert. (When you phone from the bus, you always seem to sit next to me!) You leave lots of messages, often timing your calls to avoid actually talking to anybody in person. You buzz your friends' cell phones with telegraphic short text messages, converse in real-time cyberspace with instant messages, and add a sticky note to any piece of paper you send around.</p><p>Although you've traded quality for quantity, you've still got all your connections covered. You don't even buy a quart of milk without a quick text message home to see who wants fat-free and who wants 1 percent. Your family and friends know that you're thinking of them, even when those thoughts only come out as "How r u?" on their cell-phone screens. You may not feel sure that you've used exactly the right format for every message, but overall, you're so connected, you couldn't be missing anything. Or could you?</p><p>In spite of all of your efforts, you may still be missing the most satisfying, expansive, resilient, creative way to keep in touch--the personal letter.<br></p><p>HOW IS A LETTER DIFFERENT</p><p>FROM A NOTE?</p><p>A personal letter takes longer to write than the few abrupt sentences you bang out without proofreading before you click on "send"; it takes longer to read than the blink-and-delete blitz that helps you purge your in-box; and it digs deeper than the brief handwritten note that you drop in the mail. A letter deals with issues that deserve more than a minute of attention. It aims to strengthen a relationship, not just react to a situation. A letter isn't limited to a specific message like "Can you come over?" or "Thank you for the birthday check." Rather, it can take both the writer and reader on an excursion that sets off from a home base of mutual trust: "I know you'll be interested in what I think" or "I'd like to hear your ideas on this." Whether it comes into your life onscreen or through the mail slot, the well-thought-out personal letter is irresistible to read aloud, mull over, respond to, read again, and save.</p><p>Good letter writing feels much like good conversation, and it has the same power to nourish a relationship. It even includes the same critical ingredient of taking turns, since the best way to start writing a letter is to begin where the two of you left off, by picturing your last -get--together or by rereading whatever the person sent to you. Letters allow your conversation--and your thoughts about each other--to amble along at a leisurely pace, even while other parts of your lives are galloping by.</p><p>The next time you need to connect with someone who matters, on a subject that requires more than a snap reply, stop and ask yourself, Is there a better way to do this? Is your connection as warm and strong as it could be? Think about what it feels like to settle into a personal letter that's been written just for you. Remember how connected it makes you feel, how valued and cared for. Couldn't you use more of that in your life? Whether it arrives in an envelope or on a computer screen, the personal letter is a small masterpiece in the art of staying connected.</p><p>Personal letters carry thoughts and feelings that don't come through as clearly any other way. They tap into a rich stream of history, send your reader unmistakable proof that you care, and offer an outlet for your creativity.</p><p>Even though you appreciate this lost art, you may still doubt your ability to be this kind of artist. Let's try to pinpoint what is holding you back. Is it the time involved? Are you at a loss for what to say or how to say it? Do you worry about the rules of letter writing? Although you will find in this book a wealth of guidance and ideas to get you started, remember that the aim of letter writing, like any art, is better expression and connection. The point is not to create perfect letters, but to reach out to the people you care about in a more engaging way.<br></p><p>WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN THIS BOOK</p><p>The first part of this book covers the basic tools and formats, as well as fresh ideas to help you feel confident about what and how you write. The second part includes tips for writing common kinds of letters, with sample letters to inspire you to write (or type) on your own. All you need to do is focus on how satisfying letter writing can be. Like walking to the store instead of driving, you can build your letter-writing muscle by finding ways to integrate letters into your routine. Just because you can send short messages the moment they enter your head doesn't mean you have to. Start now; each letter you write will make it easier to write the next one. If you're skeptical about how to fit letters into your crowded schedule, relax. You don't have to unplug your computer and go back to hand-cut quill pens on monogrammed paper. Instead, you can learn to take the best that the traditional letter has to offer and use it to add sparkle and civility to everything you write, type, print, attach, or e-mail. This book will show you how.<br></p><p>CHOOSE YOUR FORMAT</p><p>Your message, of course, forms the core of your letter, but before you choose your words, you'll need to decide on the best way to present them. Does the occasion call for ink on paper, or would a nicely worded e-mail be the best vehicle to convey your thoughts? Should you print out a typed letter and mail it in an envelope, or attach it to an e-mail? There is no one right choice. Most personal letters can take different forms to fit different situations and relationships. Before you begin, ask yourself how the format you choose will affect the way your message will be interpreted. Doing this will help you to make better choices, and to appreciate and interpret other people's choices when you read their letters.</p><p>Because people can't help noticing, on some level, how you choose to present your ideas, your choice of format becomes an integral part of the message. In addition to the literal meaning of your words, the visual qualities of your format provide clues to your reader about how to interpret your letter. Your timing and your choice of materials also convey messages about your relationship with your reader. Pencil on notebook paper says "I didn't forget your birthday" to your mother, but it says "I'm really clueless" to your boss's wife. A letter written by hand on Cartier stationery suggests a stronger effort to apologize to an offended hostess than a hasty e-mail message, even when it contains exactly the same words. On the other hand, a long, reassuring e-mail letter of support that comes half an hour after your best friend has called in a crisis will do much more good than the same words that arrive four days later on paper. A senator's office staff may, as a matter of policy, give more weight to a well-worded defense of your position, typed neatly on personal letterhead and signed, than they give to a checked-off, standardized postcard--in fact, they may even show your letter to the senator. And a letter to a long-lost high-school friend will call up a clearer mental picture of you if it arrives in your handwriting on good stationery than if it pops up in her e-mail in-box.</p><p>Today there are three major ways to send a personal letter; each of them has strengths and weaknesses:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can handwrite a letter and send it by mail.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can send a letter by e-mail.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can type a letter as a computer text document. Then, you can either print it out and mail it in an envelope or attach it to an e-mail.<br></p><p>There's no uniform rule for how to send which words, when, and to whom. As in all art, the ideal makes compromises with the real. You might prefer to write a long letter of advice to your daughter at college to accompany the check she suddenly needs you to send, but reality may dictate that you transfer the money to her account from your desktop computer and type your advice into an e-mail attachment that she'll open right away. In contrast, your occasional letter to your grandfather may give him much more pleasure if it arrives on paper with a family photograph or a news clipping enclosed for him to share with his friends than it would if it appeared in an e-mail in-box that he seldom opens.</p><p>Learn to trust your own instincts when you choose a format for your letter. Listen to the little voice that murmurs either "Maybe this one deserves more effort" or "Don't worry so much this time; just get it there somehow." There are many ways to improve your letter, no matter how you send it. Although one format may be more communicative than another, any letter is better than no letter at all. Don't let your aspiration to come up with the perfect missive get in the way of your effort to create one that is good enough.</p><p>When you feel comfortable with the format you choose, your authentic writing voice will stay in tune and resonate more clearly. You may give voice to a different part of yourself in what you scrawl on plain paper than in what you write in your careful calligraphy on -keepsake--quality paper stock, but you're still expressing you. Just as the same two people will have a different conversation in a pizza parlor, a French restaurant, or at a church coffee hour, each form of a personal letter can bring out a different side of your relationship.</p><p>To make your letters most personal, you'll need to strike a balance between what comes easily for you and the extra effort that you can expend to make them the best they can be. Keeping this balance in mind, let's look at each format's strengths and weaknesses.<br></p><p>Handwritten Letters</p><p>Writing by hand sets the gold standard for making yourself truly present to your reader. Traditional pen-and-paper letters offer many unique advantages. Handwritten letters feel intensely personal, weaving together your ideas with the visual art of words, color, and texture. They offer unimpeachable evidence that you believe the reader, the message, and the relationship are worth your time and your undivided attention. Letters that you handwrite on paper not only look good; they smell good and feel good, too.</p><p>Writing by hand requires only a few widely available low-tech, low-cost materials and tools that you can use anywhere, without needing a computer, Internet access, special know-how, or a place to plug in. Physically durable, letters can be archived by the recipient and reread by anyone decades--even centuries--later without special technology. A stamp that costs a couple of quarters sends them anywhere in the country, and a dollar or two sends them around the world. People welcome a handwritten letter as an ambassador from a more civilized age, and they are ready to extend that extra courtesy to the words they read and the person who wrote them. And nowadays, sheer novelty means that the person who receives a handwritten letter in the mail will sit up and take special notice of it, and of you.</p><p>Handwritten letters do have their disadvantages, though. Their delivery can be maddeningly slow and unpredictable, ranging from overnight to a full week, with no mail deliveries or pickups on Sunday and holidays. If the address or postage is wrong, the envelope may not be returned to the sender for weeks. The reader who is accustomed to hitting the reply button may take longer--or forever--to make the effort to write back by hand. Also, handwritten text can be hard to revise and correct, writing by hand can be slower than typing, and handwritten letters may be hard to write or difficult to read. The act of handwriting itself, less a matter of routine today, makes some writers overly prim and self-conscious when they pick up a pen.</p><p>If you decide to handwrite a letter, don't let concerns about these potential pitfalls hold you back. You don't have to reach impossible standards of eloquence and beauty. If your intention is to connect with your reader in the most personal way possible, just the extra effort you put into ink on paper will be greeted with appreciation and delight.<br></p><p>Letters That Are Printed Out or Attached to E-mail</p><p>You can send the next best thing to a handwritten personal letter by typing your words into a document and printing them out to mail in an envelope. You can also send a typed letter immediately by attaching it to an e-mail. With some planning and good judgment, this format can offer the best of both worlds--the time and attention that go into a well-crafted letter, plus control over the timing of its delivery.</p><p>Printout letters are easy to draft, revise, save, and go back to later, and they benefit from the computer's spell-check system and grammar suggestions. If you print these letters and mail them, you can make them more personal by adding a few sentences in your own handwriting, or by making a creative statement through your choice of paper, font, point size, type color, spacing, and margins. A recipient with poor eyesight can download the document you have attached to an e-mail and enlarge the font size or zoom in closer for easy reading. In addition, you can keep a permanent copy of what you wrote on disc or in your "sent" file.</p><p>Like e-mail, however, printout letters require electricity, a computer, and a printer, and if they are sent through the post office, they will spend a few days in transit. Printout letters can turn a normally fluent writer into a nitpicking, typography-crazed perfectionist (like me!), more obsessed with margins, fonts, and dingbats than with actual thoughts and feelings. Or it can reduce the most fluent calligrapher to a two-fingered hunt-and-pecker. And despite all the care that the writer puts into typing, printing, and mailing, some readers may feel that printout letters are just too impersonal, almost commercial, as compared with handwritten ones.</p><p>Sometimes this hybrid medium feels just right, though, for both the writer and reader. Requiring only a little more time than you would spend on an e-mail message, a letter that comes from your keyboard can feel almost as personal as a letter that flows from your pen.</p></p><h2>Wanderlust: A Novel</h2><p><b>Wanderlust</b> is the story of Audrey Driscoll. Orphaned young, Audrey has grown up caring for her eccentric millionaire grandfather and her demanding younger sister, Annabelle, who assume she will always be there for them. Sheltered yet restless, responsible beyond her years yet hungering for experience, Audrey is hopelessly bound until she herself makes the daring decision to leave. As the 1930s unfold, alone, camera in hand, she will shock friends and outrage family as she plunges headlong into the wider world.<br><br>Crossing the Atlantic aboard the luxurious <i>Queen Mary</i>, Audrey meets James and Violet Hawthorne, who will draw her into a sophisticated circle of artists and expatriates. And it is they who will introduce her to Charles Parker-Scott, in who Audrey will come to recognize a twin soul, a man propelled by relentless curiosity and driven by conflicting needs for intimacy and independence. Together they will spend an exquisite summer at Cap d'Antibes, then board the Orient Express on an adventure that will carry them to a remote outpost in China. But at the farthest reaches of this journey Aubrey must choose again. Japan has attacked China. Charles knows he must return to Europe at once. But Audrey becomes involved with a besieged orphanage and decides to remain in China without Charles, caring for the abandoned children until help arrives. <br><br>In time Audrey will return to America with a daughter of her own. While she must come home to San Francisco to confront a world irrevocably changed by time, she finds she cannot stay. From prewar Germany to London during the Blitz, from a wrenching reunion with Charles to a war zone in North Africa, again and again she must choose between the dictates of her conscience and the yearnings of her heart. For Audrey Driscoll and the men and women whose lives touch hers, wanderlust is the inescapable element. Born at a time when women were expected to stay close to home and fulfill traditional roles, Audrey is compelled to follow the thread of events that will destroy the complacency of the past and shape the future.

The carved mahogany mantelpiece in one of the two front parlors had been polished until it sparkled, its carved rosettes and female busts oiled to perfection. The long marquetry table in the center of the room was equally handsome and had been equally well tended, although it was almost impossible to see it beneath the neat stacks of treasures that had been gathering there for weeks. Carved jades, enormous silver platters, lace tablecloths, two dozen magnificently carved crystal bowls, and at least three dozen silver salt and pepper shakers, and fourteen silver candelabra. The wedding gifts were lined up on the table, as though waiting for inspection and at the end of the table a pad and black fountain pen, where each name could be inscribed, the donor and the gift, to be thanked when the bride had time. One of the pantry maids dusted the offerings daily, and the butler had seen to it that the silver was polished, just as everything in the Driscoll mansion was. There was an aura of restrained opulence here, of enormous wealth that was clearly apparent but never flaunted. The heavy velvet drapes and lace curtains in the front parlor kept out curious eyes, as did the heavy gate surrounding the house, the well-tended hedge, the trees beyond. The Driscoll home was something of a fortress.<br><br> A female voice called out from the main hall just past the sweeping staircase. The voice was barely raised but one could hear it clearly, as a tall young woman with small hips, long legs, and delicately carved shoulders stepped into the front parlor. She wore a pink satin dressing gown, and she wore her reddish hair in a chignon, and she looked to be barely more than in her early twenties. There was a softness to the drape of the satin gown, yet there was nothing soft about her. She stood erect, looking directly at the table laden with gifts, her eyes moving slowly across the treasures, nodding slowly, and then stepping closer to the table to read the names she had written down . . . Astor . . . Tudor . . . Van Camp . . . Sterling . . . Flood . . . Watson . . . Crocker . . . Tobin. . . . They were the cream of San Francisco, of California . . . of the country. Fine names, fine people, handsome gifts. Yet she did not look excited as she took a quick step to the window and stood looking out at the gardens. They were immaculately kept, just as they had been ever since her childhood. She had always loved the tulips her grandmother planted each spring, a riot of color, and so different from the flowers in Honolulu . . . she had always loved this garden. She exhaled slowly, thinking of all she had to do that day, and then wheeled slowly on a pink satin heel, squinting dark blue eyes at the richly burdened table. The gifts certainly were pretty . . . and the bride would be too . . . if she ever went for a fitting. Audrey Driscoll glanced at her slender wrist, and the narrow diamond watch that had been her mother's. It had a small ruby clasp and she loved it.<br><br> There were two pantry maids on the main floor, a butler, an upstairs maid to tend to their bedrooms, and a cook belowstairs with a maid and an assistant of her own . . . two gardeners . . . a chauffeur . . . in all a staff of ten that kept Audrey very busy. And yet she was used to all this. She had been running the house for fourteen years now, since she had come to the house from Hawaii. She had been eleven then, and Annabelle seven, when her parents had died in Honolulu. There had been nowhere to come but here. Her mind drifted back to the foggy morning they'd arrived, as Annabelle clutched her hand and sobbed loudly, terrified. Her grandfather had sent his housekeeper to bring them back from the Islands, and she and Annabelle had been seasick all the way home, but not Audrey, never Audrey. It was she who nursed old Mrs. Miller, the housekeeper, when she died of influenza four years later. But it was Mrs. Miller who had taught Audrey everything there was to know about running a fine old house like this one. She had also taught her exactly what her grandfather expected. And Audrey had learned her lessons well. She ran his house to perfection.<br><br> The whisper of her pink satin dressing gown was the only sound in the empty room as she hurried into the dining room, took her place at the empty table and pressed the discreet ruby and jade bell push beside her seat. She took her breakfast here every morning, unlike her sister, who ate breakfast upstairs, on a tray covered with impeccably starched linen.<br><br> A maid in a gray uniform with stiff white apron, cuffs, and cap immediately appeared, glancing nervously at the tall young woman sitting so erect in the Queen Anne chair she always occupied at the foot of the table.<br><br> "Yes, Miss Driscoll?"<br><br> "Only coffee for me this morning, thank you, Mary."<br><br> "Yes, Miss Driscoll." Her eyes like blue glass, there was no smile as Audrey watched her. They were afraid of her, most of them, except those of them who knew her well . . . who remembered . . . the little girl careering around the lawn . . . the childhood games . . . the bicycle . . . the time she fell out of the Australian pine tree . . . but this Mary knew none of that. She was a girl of Audrey's years, and she knew only the woman with a firm hand, and strong ideas and only secretly a splendid sense of humor. It was hidden there in the dark blue eyes . . . it was there . . . if one knew how to find it. But too few did . . . she was only . . . MissDriscoll . . . the spinster. . . .<br><br> They called her the spinster sister. Annabelle was the beauty. It was no secret between them. And Edward Driscoll had always said it openly. Annabelle had the frail blond look of an angel, that look of total fragility that was so popular in the thirties . . . and the twenties . . . and decades and centuries before that. . . . Annabelle the little princess . . . the baby . . . Audrey could still remember holding her in her arms and crooning to her after their parents had died on the way home from Bora-Bora. Their father had never been able to resist an adventure, and their mother had followed him everywhere he went, for fear that he would leave her if she didn't. In the end, she had even followed him to the bottom of the ocean. The wreckage was never found. The ship went down in a storm two days out of Papeete, and the girls were left alone in the world, with only their grandfather . . . poor Annabelle had been terrified when she saw him, and Audrey had held her hand so tightly their fingers were white as he watched them. . . . Audrey smiled to herself as she thought of it. He had terrified them even then. Or tried to . . . especially poor little Annie.<br><br> Her coffee was poured from a silver pot with an ivory handle. It had come home with her from Honolulu, along with other treasures that had belonged to her parents. Her father had cared little for all of that, and most of what her mother had brought from the mainland had remained in crates. He was far more interested in jauntering around the world, far more in love with the albums he put together after his travels. Audrey had them still, on bookshelves in her room. Her grandfather hated seeing them, they only served to remind him of his loss . . . his only son . . . The Fool, he always called him. A wasted life . . . two wasted lives . . . and two little girls foisted on him. He pretended to hate the inconvenience at the time, and insisted they would have to make themselves useful. He had demanded that Annabelle learn to embroider and sew, and she had, but his demands of Audrey had been fruitless. She enjoyed neither sewing nor drawing, nor gardening, nor baking. She was hopeless at watercolors, wrote no poetry at all, hated museums, and the symphony even more . . . but she liked photography, and adventure books, and tales of distant, far-off places. She went to lectures given by absurd, remote scholars, and often stood out at land's end, her eyes closed, sniffing the sea, thinking of the distant shores reached by the fingertips of the Pacific Ocean. And she ran a fine house for him, had a good hand with the servants, checked over the books for him each week, kept the house well stocked, and saw to it that no one cheated him of a penny. She would have been good at running any business, except that there was none to run. Only the home of Edward Driscoll.<br><br> "The tea is ready, Mary?" Without looking at her watch, she knew that it was eight fifteen and she knew that her grandfather would be down at any moment, dressed as he was each morning, as though he still had an office to go to. He would harrumph, look at Audrey angrily, as he always did, refuse stolidly to speak to her, glare at her once or twice, sip his tea, read the newspaper, eat two soft-boiled eggs, one slice of toast, drink one more cup of English tea, and then bid her good morning. His morning ritual did not unnerve Audrey, who barely seemed to take notice of him. She had begun reading his newspaper when she was twelve, and had discussed it with him seriously whenever she had a chance. At first, he had been amused, and then eventually he had realized how much of it she absorbed and how well formed her opinions were. They had had their first major political disagreement on her thirteenth birthday and she hadn't spoken to him for a week, much to his delight. He had been terribly proud of her then, and still was. It was a great source of pleasure when shortly afterward she found her own paper at her place in the morning. Since then she read her paper every morning, and when he finally wished to speak to her, she was more than happy to discuss with him any items that had caught his interest. They would then proceed to argue horribly about everything they read, from world politics to local news, even to stories about dinner parties given by their friends. They rarely agreed on anything, which was why Annabelle hated having breakfast with them.<br><br> "Yes, miss. The tea is ready." The maid in the gray uniform said it as though gritting her teeth, bracing herself for an enemy attack, and a moment later it came. His careful step in the hall, as his impeccably shined shoes left the Persian rug for a moment before meeting another in the dining room, his growling harrumph as he pulled back his chair, sat down, and stared only for a fraction of an instant at Audrey, and then carefully unfolded his newspaper. The maid poured tea as he glared at her, and then cautiously he sipped it. By then, Audrey was engrossed in the news, totally unaware of how the summer sunlight shone on her copper hair, and her long delicate hands holding the newspaper. For an instant, he watched her, caught as he often was by her beauty, though she didn't know it. It was that which made her even more lovely, the fact that she never gave it any thought. Unlike her sister who thought about nothing else.<br><br> "Good morning." It was a full thirty minutes later before the words erupted from him, his immaculate white beard barely moving as he spoke, his blue eyes a blaze of summer sky that belied his eighty summers. The maid jumped as he spoke, as she did each morning. She hated serving him breakfast, just as Annabelle hated eating with him. Only Audrey seemed impervious to the gruffness of his manner. She acted no differently than she would have if he had smiled and kissed her hand and called her pretty names each morning.<br><br> There were no pretty names on Edward Driscoll's tongue. There never were. Never had been, except for his wife, but she had been dead for twenty years, and he had pretended to be hardened ever since then, and in many ways he was. He was a handsome, beautifully groomed man, once tall and still erect with snowy white hair, a full beard and handsome, broad shoulders. He walked with a careful but determined step, a silver-tipped ebony cane held in one powerful hand, as he gesticulated forcefully with the other. As he did now, glancing over at Audrey.<br><br> "I suppose you read the news. They nominated him, the fools. Damn fools, all of them." His voice boomed in the wood-paneled dining room as the young maid quaked and Audrey unsuccessfully concealed a smile. She met his eyes squarely with her own blue eyes, and there was a hint of similarity between them.<br><br> "I thought you'd be interested in reading that."<br><br> "Interested!" He shouted at her. "He doesn't have a chance, thank God. Hoover will get in again. But they should have gone with Smith instead of that idiot." He had been reading of Franklin Roosevelt's nomination at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, in Lippmann's column. And Audrey had easily anticipated his reaction. He was a staunch supporter of Herbert Hoover, in spite of the fact that this had been the worst year of the Depression thus far. But her grandfather had refused to acknowledge that. He still thought Hoover a fine man, despite the armies of starving unemployed across the nation. The Depression had not touched them, and so he found it impossible to fathom the extent to which it had touched others.<br><br> But Hoover's politics had caused Audrey's "defection," as Edward Driscoll called it. She was going to vote for the Democrats this time, and she was very pleased with Franklin Roosevelt's nomination.<br><br> "He won't get in, you know, so don't waste your time looking so pleased for him." Edward Driscoll looked irate as he set down the paper.<br><br> "He might. He really should." Her face sobered, thinking of the economic condition the country was in. It was terrifying, and it always upset her. Her grandfather didn't like talking about it, because doing so implied that it was Hoover's fault. Annabelle didn't seem to care what he said, but Audrey was very, very different. "Grandfather," she eyed him carefully now, fully aware of what she was doing and the reaction she would get from him, "how can you pretend that nothing is happening out there? This is 1932, scores of banks just went under in Chicago, right before the Democratic Convention, our whole country is out of work, starving in the streets. How the devil can you ignore that?"<br><br> "It's not his fault!" He banged a fist on the table and his eyes blazed.<br><br> "The hell it's not!" Audrey spoke heatedly but with an undertone of ironic candor.<br><br> "Audrey! Your language!" She did not apologize to him, she didn't feel she had to. He knew her well and she knew him. And she loved him dearly, whatever his politics were.<br><br> She smiled at him now as he glared ominously at her. "I'll make you a bet right now that Franklin Roosevelt gets in."<br><br> "Nonsense!" He brushed away the thought with a hand that had been only Republican for a lifetime.<br><br> "Five dollars says he does."<br><br> He narrowed his eyes at her. "You know, despite all my efforts, you have the manners of a truck driver."<br><br> Audrey Driscoll laughed and stood up, looking anything but that in the pink satin dressing gown with slippers to match, and there were tiny diamonds clipped to her ears.</p><h2>Storms Can&#39;t Hurt the Sky: A Buddhist Path Through Divorce</h2><p>Buddhism has been applied to everything from parenting to golf, but until now no one has offered Buddhist principles as a healing path through divorce.

Don't miss her latest,&nbsp;<i><b>Miss Julia Raises the Roof</b></i>, coming April 2018 from Viking.<br><br></b> In her latest romp, Miss Julia&#x2014;now Mrs. Sam Murdoch&#x2014;returns from her whirlwind elopement, only to find herself roped into Hazel Marie's scheme to raise money by throwing a beauty pageant. Though it all seems a tad distasteful, it's nothing compared to the revelation that Pigeon Forge, the marriage mill across the state line that wedded Julia and Sam, might not be legitimate. And a flustered Julia can't help wondering whether she and Sam can keep up appearances before the town finds out they might be living in sin.</p><p><p><b><b>Ann B. Ross</b>&nbsp;</b>is the author of eighteen novels featuring the popular Southern heroine Miss Julia, as well as&nbsp;<i>Etta Mae's Worst Bad-Luck Day</i>, a novel about one of Abbotsville's other most outspoken residents: Etta Mae Wiggins.&nbsp;Ross holds a doctorate in English from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has taught literature at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.<br><br></p>Miss Julia is fast becoming a Southern literary icon, with narrator Cynthia Darlow's excellent presentation aiding her popularity. In this outing, not only is Miss Julia questioning the validity of her wedding chapel marriage, but she's also assisting Hazel Marie, her late husband's mistress, with a beauty contest for Miss Abbot County Sheriff's Department. The usual luscious ingredients of Southern manners, sex, and modern and traditional values collide with human foibles, causing hilarious results. Darlow is splendid as she personifies Little Lloyd (a 9-year-old white boy), Miss Lillian and Leticia (Julia's African-American maid and her granddaughter), Mr. Pickens (Hazel Marie's detective/beau), and Sam (Miss Julia's intended) plus the young, unformed beauty pageant contestants. Darlow's skill lies in each character being splendid without overdoing the accent. One of Ross's best for old--and new--fans. S.G.B.

It surrounds us and it holds us up. Our Northwest Coast art is ingrained in the social fabric and oral histories of our clans. It is characterized by formline&#x2014;a term used to describe the unique artistic style of the indigenous people of the Northwest Coast. Formline is a composition of lines whose widths vary to create form. The overall collection of these compose an image or design. The formline designs may represent stories of Raven (the Trickster), historic events, clan crests, or other concepts. Formline is an art that dates back more than two thousand years (Brown 1998). Two-dimensional formline is depicted on objects such as bentwood boxes, clan hats, and house screens. Though formline is drawn in two dimensions, it transforms to be adapted to three-dimensional pieces, such as masks and totem poles. In this booklet we hope to provide a concise and easy-to-understand guide for interpreting Northwest Coast formline art.</p><p></p><h2>The Spiritual Life Of Children</h2><p>In this eighth and final volume in his Pulitzer Prize�winning Children of Crisis series, Coles examines the religious and spiritual lives of children. By using children&#39;s own words and pictures, Coles presents their deepest feelings.</p><p>Robert Coles is a winner of the National Medal of Freedom.Pulitzer prize-winning Harvard child psychiatrist Coles, a social scientist and prolific writer of books dealing with children's perceptions of poverty, moral and political stress, and crisis, shares his research regarding children's understanding of and reflections on spiritual matters. Inspired by his psychoanalytic training and a conversation with Anna Freud, Coles interviewed in-depth over 500 Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and agnostic children, ages eight to 12, living in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. What Cole delivers, in between thoughtful but nonjargonistic explanations of children's remarks and art work, are detailed, fascinating conversations between an expert interviewer and children struggling to understand God and the contradictions of their religious teachings.

Such is the teaching of Sayadaw U Tejaniya, who himself learned to cultivate awareness in the raucous years he spent in the Burmese textile business before taking his final monastic ordination at the age of thirty-six. Train yourself to be aware of the clinging and aversion that arise in any situation, he teaches. If you can learn to do that, calm and deep insight will naturally follow. It&#x2019;s a method that works as well for sorting the laundry or doing data entry as it does in formal sitting meditation. &#x201c;The object of attention is not really important,&#x201d; he teaches, &#x201c;the observing mind that is working in the background to be aware is of real importance. If the observing is done with the right attitude, any object is the right object.&#x201d;</p><p>SAYADAW U TEJANIYA is a Burmese monk in the lineage of Mahasi Sayadaw who teaches meditation at Shwe Oo Min Dhamma Sukha Forest Meditation Center in Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar. He&#39;s unique among the more high-profile monastic teachers of his tradition in that, though he began practice under his teacher at age thirteen, he didn&#39;t enter monastic life till he was nearly forty--after an active career in his family&#39;s textile business. His teaching emphasizes the application of awareness to every aspect of life, de-emphasizing the centrality of practice forms--even as he teaches them rigorously--and his style is relaxed, funny, and informed by his intimate knowledge of the workaday world. He has taught in Australia, China, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States.&#x201c;Sayadaw U Tejaniya's,&nbsp;<i>When Awareness Becomes Natural</i>, points the way to a natural awareness that reveals with vivid clarity all the workings of the mind. This is the work of an eminently skilled meditation master, who uses many examples from his own life and practice to help us understand and free our minds. There is both simplicity of expression and subtlety of understanding in Sayadaw's teachings, and they will be of great help to both beginning and experienced meditators.&nbsp; Highly recommended for all Dharma practitioners.&#x201d;&nbsp;- Joseph Goldstein, author of <i>Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening<br></i><br>"A wonderfully fresh and lively contribution, rooted in classical Theravadin tradition and at the same time of practical and contemporary relevance, illustrated by intimate, vivid personal examples of how dharma practice can help us all learn how to live with more wisdom and kindness. "&#x2014;Larry Rosenberg, author of&nbsp;<i>Breath by Breath: The Liberating Practice of Insight Meditation</i></p><h2>Froggy Gets Dressed Board Book</h2><p>Rambunctious Froggy hops out into the snow for a winter frolic but is called back by his mother to put on some necessary articles of clothing.</p><p>One morning Froggy wakes up and discovers snow--glorious snow! Of course he immediately wants to frolic outside, but his sleepy mother reminds him that frogs are supposed to sleep all winter. "Wake up when the snow melts," she calls out from her cozy bed. But Froggy insists. So off he goes after putting on his socks--"zoop," his boots--"zup," his hat--"zat," and his scarf--"zwit." The playful sound effects are perfect for read-aloud merriment and the watercolor illustrations by Frank Remkiewicz (<i>Horrible Harry</i>) are comic-strip silly. As soon as Froggy gets outside his mother calls out to remind him to put on his pants. This, as any child knows, means laboriously pulling off all footwear. "Zwit, zat, zup, zut." Then he forgets his coat and it's more "zut, znap, zum." And then--horror of horrors!--his mother yells out in front of all his animal playmates, "Froggy, your underwear!" (Which of course elicits giggles.) Ultimately, the on- and off-again dressing is too exhausting for Froggy and he winds up right back where he belongs. Good night, Froggy.

Since then he has published more than 20 picture books, including the popular&nbsp; <b>Froggy</b>&nbsp;series and the young adult novel,&nbsp; <b>Where's Home?</b> <p> "There are worlds of possibility within our own imaginations from which we can create stories that can make someone want to cry or laugh, play a saxophone or make a snowman. This act of writing, for me, is a part of my celebration of life, a way to give back a little for all that I have been given. Kind of thanks."</p> <p> Jonathan London started writing poetry in his late teens. Although he received a Masters Degree in Social Sciences and never formally studied literature or creative writing, he began to consider himself a "writer" about the time he graduated from college. After college he became a dancer in a modern dance company and worked at numerous low-paying jobs as a laborer or counselor.</p> <p> However, during this twenty-year period, London continued to write. He wrote poems and short stories for adults, earning next to nothing despite being published in many literary magazines. "It wasn't until I had kids of my own that I became a writer for children," he explains. "It all started with telling them stories when they were very young. I wrote down one of these stories, and it became&nbsp;<b>The Owl Who Became the Moon</b>, my first picture book sale (though it was my fourth to appear in print).

After leaving home at the age of fifteen, the precocious child of unconventional hippies had enrolled in college while her band, Throwing Muses, was getting off the ground amid rumors of a major label deal. Then everything changed: she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and found herself in an emotional tailspin; she started medication, but then discovered she was pregnant. An intensely personal and moving account of that pivotal year, <i>Rat Girl</i> is sure to be greeted eagerly by Hersh's many fans.</p><p>Kristin Hersh has released more than twenty albums over the course of her career which have sold more than one million copies worldwide. She records solo, as well as with her bands Throwing Muses and 50 Foot Wave.&#x201c;<i>Rat Girl</i> is the story of a wide-eyed soul coming to maturity in the ridiculous cacophony of modern life. Although it is supposedly about what we call, for lack of a better term, 'manic depression,' it has nearly no interest in such grim diagnostic thinking. It is instead awestruck - by music, feeling, perception, wild animals, mystery, dreams, 'the gorgeous and terrible things that live in your house.' It is an original beauty.&#x201d; &#x2013; Mary Gaitskill, author of <i>Veronica</i> and <i>Don't Cry</i><br>&#x201c;Sensitive and emotionally raw... it is also wildly funny.&#x201d; &#x2013; Rob Sheffield, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Funny, freaky, fidgety, Hersh's memoir is the book a fan didn't dare hope for: a beacon in a dark field, illuminating the mysterious and the mundane. Beautifully, honestly, written and as close as you will ever get to being in a Throwing Muses song.&#x201d; &#x2013; Wesley Stace, author of <i>Misfortune</i> and <i>By George</i><br>#8 on Rolling Stone&#x2019;s list of The 25 Greatest Rock Memoirs of All Time<br>&#x201c;Her narrative voice is warm, friendly and surprisingly funny. Deep down it's a story about messed-up kids finding one other, starting a band, and accidentally scrounging up an audience of similarly messed-up kids. It belongs on the shelf next to Michael Azerrad's classic <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Rolling Stone</i><br>&#x201c;Ultra-vivid writing and intense honesty is what you'd expect from Kristin Hersh, one of America's finest songwriters. But <i>Rat Girl</i> is also a startlingly funny and touching memoir of her mid-Eighties moment as the bi- polar, pregnant, intermittently homeless frontwoman of a rising indie-rock band. It's a gripping journey into mental chaos and out the other side.&#x201d; &#x2013; Simon Reynolds, author of <i>Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-84</i></p><h2>The Lost Recipe for Happiness: A Novel</h2><p><b>In this sumptuous novel, Barbara O&#x2019;Neal offers readers a celebration of food, family, and love as a woman searches for the elusive ingredient we&#x2019;re all hoping to find. . . .</b><br><br> It&#x2019;s the opportunity Elena Alvarez has been waiting for&#x2014;the challenge of running her own kitchen in a world-class restaurant.

Her only companion was Luis, the forty-something El Salvadorian commis, who stirred his stockpots with a hand so brown and squat it looked like a hand balloon. He sang cheerfully under his breath, a bloody old Spanish folk song about a conquistador taking revenge on his enemy. It made Elena think of nights at the VFW when she was eleven or twelve, drinking Cokes while everyone danced the two-step. No doubt it made Luis think of bodegas back home.<br><br>Humming tunelessly along with him, Elena stood at the stove, stirring pale pink shallots and yellow onions with a long wooden spoon, thinking of the things she needed to check for service today. She thought of conquistadores and the plate armor they'd worn to protect themselves from arrows.<br>Mainly, she thought of Dmitri, who had betrayed her.<br><br>Her whole body ached this morning, back and hips from the old injuries, shoulders and neck from trying to erect the armor she had to assemble afresh each and every day, finely honed plates of sharp arrogance and bad language beneath which she&#x2014;the secret and guarded Elena&#x2014;could hide. She rolled her shoulder blades down her back, reminded herself to stand tall.<br><br>Shake it off.<br><br>When the onions were nearly done, she crushed garlic with the flat of her knife, and was about to scrape it into the mix when Dmitri burst through the back door. Hearing his fury in the slam of the door, she pulled the pan off the fire and turned to meet his anger.<br><br>Long and lean, with severe planes in his beautiful Russian face, he strode through the kitchen and flung a newspaper down on the counter. She turned off the burner and wiped her hands.<br><br>The paper was turned to the front page of the Lifestyle section, and featured a photo taken two weeks before. Of Elena, dressed in chef's whites at the end of a shift, long blonde hair pulled back from her face beneath the bright scarves she had adopted as her trademark. She lifted a glass of wine to the camera with a crooked smile and a saucy cock of a brow. It was a good photo, she thought again. It made her look younger than her thirty-eight years, sexier, charming. The headline read:<br>STANDING UP TO THE HEAT<br>BLUE TURTLE CHEF SAYS LIFE AS A FEMALE IN<br>THE KITCHEN IS NOT EASY, BUT WORTH IT<br>"I saw it," she said mildly.<br><br>"You are fired."<br><br>"What?" Her head jerked up. "Come on, Dmitri. It's not my fault she liked me better than you. And you're right there in the first paragraph anyway!"<br><br>"It is my kitchen. Your focus should have been on the restaurant, on the menu. Not on yourself."<br><br>"It is not your kitchen!" she said, slamming her knife down on the counter. "You have the title of chef, but you know as well as I do that we built this menu and this kitchen together. It's as much mine as it is yours."<br><br>"Is it?" He raised his index finger. "One question, hmm?" When he got angry or excited or passionate, his speech slipped into the Russian accent he'd labored over many years to lose. "Whose name is on that door?"<br><br>She wiped her hands, heat in her throat. "Yours."<br><br>He grabbed the paper, slapped it with the fingers of his other hand. It sounded like a gunshot. "And where is the chef of the Blue Turtle in the article?" His eyes, the color of cognac, burned with a yellow heat. "Hmm?"<br><br>"Isn't it supposed to be about the restaurant?"<br><br>He gave her a withering look. The restaurant did not belong to him. The kitchen did.<br><br>"You told me to talk to her." Elena shrugged. "I talked."<br><br>A long, simmering silence hung between them, filled with the scent of onions and bruised garlic and the New Mexican chiles she'd asked to have imported. Feigning disdain for his tantrum, she turned the burner back off, pulled the pan back to the fire, and scraped the garlic into it. The back of her neck burned with satisfaction, with worry and loss, with desire. She could smell him over the food, a heady mix of sweat and spices, cigarettes and sex, which he'd not had with her. Beneath her armor, her flesh wept.<br><br>"It was revenge, Elena."<br><br>Methodically, she swirled the garlic into the butter, and put the spoon down. Met his eyes.<br>The minute the reporter had come through the doors with her old-school feminist hair&#x2014;steely, frizzled salt and pepper&#x2014;Elena had known she had a chance to get back at Dmitri.<br><br>And more, she'd earned it. Not only had he seized the glory from their joint effort to create the menu and the environment of the Blue Turtle, but two months ago, he'd moved out of their shared apartment to live with a girl with breasts like fried eggs and the guileless hero worship only a twenty-three-year-old CIA graduate could afford.<br><br>That would be the Culinary Institute of America, not the Central Intelligence Agency.<br><br>The garlic could not be neglected. Elena stirred in fire-roasted Anaheim chiles, letting them warm slowly. The scent had zest, dampness, appetite to it. Even Dmitri could not resist bending toward it, inhaling it. She looked at the top of his head, the thick hair.<br><br>Looked away.<br><br>The interview might have started as revenge, but it had become something more as Elena let herself open up to the reporter, her sharp eyes, her sympathy. "She was a feminist, Dmitri," she said in the calm voice she had cultivated, "a woman who wanted to do a story about a woman in a man's world." She adjusted the flame the tiniest bit. "I gave it to her. And it worked&#x2014;the restaurant is on the front page of the Lifestyle section."<br><br>"You're fired," he said, punching the air with a finger.<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "Don't be ridiculous."<br><br>"Oh, I assure you, I am not. When I come back here in an hour, I want you gone, not a trace."<br><br>"Dmitri!"<br><br>He turned, crisp as a Cossack, and marched out of the kitchen.<br><br>Automatically, Elena pulled the skillet from the burner and stared after him, pursing her lips. He'd fired her in the past, when they'd had one of their spectacular fights, only to call an hour or a day later to beg forgiveness. He needed her, Elena knew. More than he had sense to realize.<br><br>And he would likely calm down this time, too. Call later and beg her to come back.<br><br>Luis, who had pretended not to watch the scene unfolding, tsked.<br><br>Elena, embarrassed, shook her head. "He'll get over it."<br><br>"Si."<br><br>But there was, suddenly, weariness in her. Too many fights, too many late nights spent trying to fix whatever it was that had gone wrong. She felt the exhaustion at the base of her neck, along the backs of her eyes. She lacked the energy to go another round with him. As much as she hated to start over&#x2014;again!&#x2014;this was broken. It was time to admit it.<br><br>She should never have begun. From the moment of their first meeting, she'd known that he was dangerous to her, a woman in a man's world. For well over a year, she had resisted him, sticking to her unbroken rule to never sleep with a man who had power over her, and Dmitri was even more dangerous than most, a chef with a Russian accent and the mouth of a rock star, a man with that intelligent, amoral twinkle in his eye.<br><br>But he pursued her, relentlessly, and Elena had fallen. Fallen to his genius as much as his beauty, fallen to his supposedly undying adoration of her, the mark of a man who lived on his charm.<br><br>Now she would pay the price. This silent Sunday morning, she folded her apron and put it on the pass-out bar, then went to the staff room, changed from her chef's whites and clogs into jeans and a long-sleeved shirt tie-dyed in soft pink and orange, with tiny dancing skeletons on it. A gift from one of her sisters last Christmas, to remind her of home. Packed everything from her locker into the duffel she carried to and fro, and finally went out to the dining room for one last look.<br><br>The Blue Turtle had been her home for three years, the menu a loving union of Dmitri's old-school French methods and Elena's Santa Fe roots. Vancouverites, adventurous eaters that they were, adored the exotic fusion. The restaurant was a success in a very crowded market, and was attracting international press attention.<br><br>This was her home, not some faraway town. A blister of fury zapped from the base of her spine through the top of her head. Bastard. How dare he banish her like this?<br><br>Luis raised his chin. "Vaya con Dios."<br><br>Elena nodded. Hiking the duffel over her shoulder, she swallowed the hollow sense of loss and headed out to the softness of an early Vancouver morning. For a long moment, she stood there on the sidewalk with a hole in her chest, trying to think what to do.<br><br>How depressing to lose yet another home. Another and another and another. She had grown fond of this one, had thought perhaps it might be the one place. Her place.<br><br>Now what?<br><br>Across the street, English Bay lay like a mirror in the fresh opalescence of morning. A storm gathered in the distant west, sending a gust of rain-scented wind over her face. She shook loose the hair on her shoulders, and tried to bring her mind to something practical. What could she have for breakfast? There was some fresh spinach, perhaps a hunk of cheese, some pear salad left from the night before.<br><br>A man suddenly stepped out of the doorway, and, startled, Elena took a step backward to let him pass. There was an air of confidence about him, something both severe and sensual. Very dark glasses hid his eyes. A thin, hip goatee circled his mouth. She admired the spotlessness of his black jacket, the jeans he wore casually beneath it. Strong thighs, she noticed, relieved to discover Dmitri had not entirely killed her pleasure in the opposite sex.<br><br>The man gave her a nod. "Good morning."<br><br>She inclined her head. A silk scarf, ribboned with faint orange and pink stripes, looped around his neck. Elegant. Smart. Maybe he was French. "Bonjour," she said with a faint smile.<br><br>To her surprise, he paused. "Are you Elena Alvarez?"<br><br>"Who wants to know?"<br><br>"Sorry," he said, tugging off his hat and sunglasses in a single fluid gesture. He had the uncanny grace and coloring of something supernatural&#x2014;a vampire, perhaps. Tumbles of black hair fell down on a pale, finely boned face. "I'm Julian Liswood."<br><br>"Ah." The owner of the restaurant. He carried a newspaper under his arm&#x2014;he must have seen the article. Elena brushed her hands together&#x2014;finished. "Dmitri already fired me, so don't bother."<br><br>His lips, that only pool of color in his face, quirked. "On the contrary. I came to Vancouver to speak with you. The commis in there told me you had just left. Do you have a few minutes?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>He studied her face. "You're quite blonde," he commented. "For someone named Alvarez."<br><br>"Does that figure into the discussion?"<br><br>A flash of a smile crossed his mouth. "No."<br><br>Elena waited. He wasn't what she'd always imagined, either. The face was not beautiful&#x2014;that high-bridged nose and sharp cheekbones&#x2014;but the hair was good. His eyes were steady and very dark and intelligent. It was hard to tell how old he was, but she knew he'd made his first movie when she was in high school. A decade older than she? He didn't look it. Behind them a wind swept closer, bringing with it the sound of rain.<br><br>"Will you let me buy you breakfast?" he asked. "We'll talk."<br><br>"I'm a chef, as it happens, and my apartment is not far away." She hoped he would offer her a job. "Why don't I cook instead?"<br><br>"Sadly, I do not have enough time. I have to fly to LA this morning to pick up my daughter."<br><br>"Then by all means, let's go to the Sylvia." It was an agreeable and famous old hotel.<br><br>They walked there beneath a sky that grew darker by the moment, heavy with rain. He moved with such effortless, long strides that Elena looked at his feet to see if he was actually touching the sidewalk. She felt a little dizzy, overwhelmed, and tried to think of something to say. "Don't you have a movie out right now?"<br><br>"It's just gone to DVD." He looked sideways at her. "Are you a horror fan?"<br><br>"Not really. I like ghost stories, but the slasher flicks are too violent for me, honestly."<br><br>"I prefer ghost stories," he said, pulling open the door.<br><br>She looked at him. "Why don't you make more of them, then?"<br><br>"The others are in fashion." He tucked his hat in his pocket. "They finance my smaller projects."<br><br>A man in a white shirt and white tie came hustling forward and seated them at a table by the windows. Elena ordered tea and milk; Mr. Liswood, coffee. In the corner, she saw a cluster of uniformed staff whispering, looking their way. She nodded toward them. "You've caused a stir."<br>He skimmed the jacket from his shoulders. "I don't think it's me."<br><br>A woman held up the newspaper and pointed to the picture. She waved, smiling. "Oh," Elena said, pleased. She waved back.<br><br>"Your first taste of fame?"<br><br>She thought of long ago, the New Mexico newspapers. But that had been more notoriety than fame, so dark and heavy she'd had to flee to escape it. "In a way," she said, then shifted her attention back to him. "But you're no stranger to it, are you?"<br><br>"I am not usually recognized for myself," he said, "but for the wives I have unwisely collected."<br><br>His rueful straightforwardness disarmed her, and Elena laughed, the sound shaking loose from some rusty place in her chest. His wives were tabloid fodder, starlets who began their careers in the teen slasher flicks that had made him his fortune. Restaurants were a sideline. Celebrity owners were not always the most adept, but Julian Liswood had earned the respect of the press and&#x2014;harder to capture&#x2014;his workforce. The Blue Turtle was the third he'd opened to spectacular success.<br><br>Elena said, "They have been rather beautiful wives, as I recall."<br><br>"Well, you know what they say: never marry a girl prettier than you."<br><br>She thought, with a pang, of Dmitri. "Been there."<br><br>"Hard to imagine."<br><br>"Oh, believe me&#x2014;" She almost said, there have been so many men, but that would have been too frank. Outside, rain began to splat against the window. She shivered slightly. Pulling her cup toward her, she said, "Now, tell me, Mr. Liswood, what do you have in mind?"<br><br>"Please call me Julian."<br><br>"I'll try. Julian."<br><br>He took his time, stirring a lump of rough brown sugar into his coffee with a tiny spoon. His oval nails were manicured, and she wondered what kind of man had time for something like that. But of course, in his world, the veneer of such details would be required. She envisioned a cocktail party sparkling with beautiful people, manned by obsequious servers. It made her nervous.</p><h2>The Revealing Word: A Dictionary of Metaphysical Terms (Charles Fillmore Reference Library)</h2><p>The Revealing Word is a volume in Charles Fillmore Reference Library that will help you bring the Bible to life.

But when Europeans began to colonize the American continents, it became something else entirely -- a cultural touchstone of pleasure and success, and a coveted commodity that would transform the world economy forever. Iain Gately&#39;s Tobacco tells the epic story of an unusual plant and its unique relationship with the history of humanity, from its obscure ancient beginnings, through its rise to global prominence, to its current embattled state today. In a lively narrative, Gately makes the case for the tobacco trade being the driving force behind the growth of the American colonies, the foundation of Dutch trading empire, the underpinning cause of the African slave trade, and the financial basis for our victory in the American Revolution. Informed and erudite, Tobacco is a vivid and provocative look into the complex history of this precious plant. &#34;A rich, complex history ... Deeply engaging and witty.&#34; -- Carmela Ciuraru, Los Angeles Times &#34;Ambitious ... informative and perceptive ... Gately is an amusing writer, which is a blessing.&#34; -- Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post &#34;[Gately] documents the resourcefulness with which human beings of every class, religion, race, and continent have pursued the lethal leaf.&#34; -- John Leland, The New York Times Book Review</p><p>Iain Gately's <i>Tobacco</i> is a sweeping cultural history of the world's most prevalent addiction, and it's probably the best book ever written on its subject. Gately begins in pre-Columbian America, where the natives made tobacco "their most popular gift to the rest of humanity," and continues through all the cantankerous smoking litigation of the 1990s. The story touches on just about every subject imaginable: tobacco in literature, the movies, and society. It would be wrong to call Gately an advocate of smoking, but he clearly takes pleasure, for example, in noting that Hitler's Nazis launched one of history's most vigorous anti-smoking initiatives. The book is full of delicious trivia: Many of Shakespeare's contemporaries smoked, but there's no evidence that the Bard himself did, and none of his plays make any mention of smoking; he "kept his writing a smoke-free zone." Nevertheless, reports Gately with a smirk, there is "archaeological evidence proving that smoking was going on around the Shakespeare household in Stratford-upon-Avon during his life." Smoking aficionados won't want to miss <i>Tobacco</i>, and it's a much healthier gift for them than a box of cigars. <i>--John Miller</i>Iain Gately is the author of &#34;Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization,&#34; Raised in Hong Kong, he studied law at Cambridge University and worked in the financial markets of London.</p><h2>X-MEN VS.

In 1884 she married Charles Water Stetson. After giving birth, Charlotte sank into a deep depression. She entered a sanitarium in Philadelphia to undergo the 'rest cure', a controversial treatment, which forbade any type of physical activity or intellectual stimulation. In 1892, she published the now-famous story &#x201c;The Yellow Wall-Paper.&#x201d; In 1898, her most famous nonfiction book, <i>Women and Economics</i>, was published. With its publication, and subsequent translation into seven languages, Gilman earned international acclaim. In 1900, she married her first cousin, George Houghton Gilman.

Despite the affluence of her famous ancestors, she was born into poverty. Her father abandoned the family when she was a child, and she received just four years of formal education. At an early age she vowed never to marry, hoping instead to devote her life to public service. In 1882, however, at the age of twenty-one, she was introduced to Charles Walter Stetson (1858-1911), a handsome Providence, Rhode Island, artist, and the two were married in 1884. Charlotte Stetson became pregnant almost immediately after their marriage, gave birth to a daughter, and sank into a deep depression that lasted for several years. She eventually entered a sanitarium in Philadelphia to undergo the &#x201c;rest cure,&#x201d; a controversial treatment for nervous prostration, which forbade any type of physical activity or intellectual stimulation. After a month, she returned to her husband and child and subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown. In 1888, she left Stetson and moved with her daughter to California, where her recovery was swift. In the early 1890s, she began a career in writing and lecturing, and in 1892, she published the now-famous story &#x201c;The Yellow Wall-Paper.&#x201d; A volume of poems, <i>In This Our World,</i> followed a year later. In 1894, she relinquished custody of her young daughter to her ex-husband and endured public condemnation for her actions. In 1898, her most famous nonfiction book, <i>Women and Economics,</i> was published. With its publication, and its subsequent translation into seven languages, Gilman earned international acclaim. In 1900, she married her first cousin, George Houghton Gilman. Over the next thirty-five years, she wrote and published hundreds of stories and poems and more than a dozen books, including <i>Concerning Children</i> (1900), <i>The Home: Its Work and Influence</i> (1903), <i>Human Work</i> (1904), <i>The Man Made World; Or, Our Androcentric Culture</i> (1911), <i>Moving the Mountain</i> (1911), <i>Herland</i> (1915), <i>With Her in Ourland</i> (1916), <i>His Religion and Hers: A Study of the Faith of Our Fathers and the Work of Our Mothers</i> (1923), and <i>The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman: An Autobiography</i> (1935). From 1909 to 1916 she singlehandedly wrote, edited, and published her own magazine, <i>The Forerunner,</i> in which the utopian romance <i>Herland</i> first appeared. In 1932, Gilman learned that she had inoperable breast cancer. Three years later, at the age of seventy-five, she committed suicide, intending her death to demonstrate her advocacy of euthanasia. In 1993, Gilman was named in a poll commissioned by the Siena Research Institute as the sixth most influential woman of the twentieth century. In 1994, she was inducted posthumously into the National Women&#x2019;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>DENISE D.

Most of all, I thank my husband, Michael K. Barylski, for his ongoing love, support, encouragement, and interest in my work on Gilman.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Near the end of her autobiography, Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935) sardonically remarks that &#x201c;This is the woman&#x2019;s century, the first chance for the mother of the world to rise to her full place, ... to remake humanity, to rebuild the suffering world&#x2014;and the world waits while she powders her nose.&#x201d;1 Frustrated both by women who transformed themselves into sex objects for the pleasure of men and by society&#x2019;s gender-based double standard, Gilman created a fictional utopia, <i>Herland</i> (1915), where such frivolous items as face powder would be obsolete. Indeed, not only is Herland devoid of feminine vanity of any kind, its all-female inhabitants have created a peaceful, progressive, environmentally conscious country from which men have been absent for two thousand years. Rather than suffering deprivation, the women have thrived. <i>Herland</i> depicts a healthy, alternative view of women and demonstrates a degree of social reform that Gilman, caught in the conventional trappings of the turn-of-the-century patriarchal society, could envision only in her imagination.</p><p>Born Charlotte Anna Perkins in Hartford, Connecticut, on July 3, 1860, Gilman was the great-niece of Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> (1852), and Henry Ward Beecher, the renowned minister. Despite her famous ancestry (her great-grandfather was the distinguished theologian Lyman Beecher), Gilman lived a troubled childhood. After her father abandoned the family, her mother, a part-time day-school teacher, was left to raise two children on her own. With only meager earnings, it was a precarious existence. During her adolescence, Gilman became a passionate rebel, defiantly rejecting the conventional roles deemed appropriate for late-nineteenth-century women. At the age of eighteen, she entered the Rhode Island School of Design, where she studied drawing and painting. By the time she was twenty she had decided to devote her life to public service. Although she had vowed never to marry, in January 1882 she met Rhode Island artist Charles Walter Stetson, who proposed marriage just two-and-a-half weeks later. Fearing that marriage would compromise her desire to work, Gilman quickly declined. In a letter to Stetson, Gilman tried to express her reservations: &#x201c;As much as I love you I love WORK better, &amp; I cannot make the two compatible.... I am meant to be useful &amp; strong, to help many and do my share in the world&#x2019;s work, but not to be loved.&#x201d;2 Stetson persisted with marriage proposals for nearly two years, however, and despite serious misgivings on Gilman&#x2019;s part, they were married on May 2, 1884.</p><p>Within weeks after the wedding Gilman became pregnant and sank into a deep depression. Her daughter, Katharine Beecher Stetson, was born on March 23, 1885. Gilman recalled in her autobiography both the severity of her distress and the self-blame that she suffered:</p><p></p><p>Absolute incapacity. Absolute misery.... Prominent among the tumbling suggestions of a suffering brain was the thought, &#x201c;You did it yourself! You had health and strength and hope and glorious work before you&#x2014;and you threw it all away. You were called to serve humanity, and you cannot serve yourself. No good as a wife, no good as a mother, no good at anything. And you did it yourself!&#x201d; ... I would hold [the baby] close, and instead of love and happiness, feel only pain.... Nothing was more utterly bitter than this, that even motherhood brought no joy.3</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the spring of 1887, Gilman traveled to Philadelphia, where she underwent the &#x201c;rest cure&#x201d; from the leading nerve specialist, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell. The treatment he prescribed required Gilman to live as domestic a life as possible, to have the baby with her at all times, and to never touch a pen, a paintbrush, or a pencil for the remainder of her life. Within months after returning home, she suffered a nervous breakdown. With the modicum of rational intelligence that remained, Gilman garnered the courage to reject Mitchell&#x2019;s advice and to immerse herself again in her work. Her marriage could not survive under the strain of her resolve, however, and in the fall of 1887, she and Stetson agreed to separate. In 1888, Gilman left with Katharine for Pasadena, California, where her recovery was swift. Freed from the constraints of marriage, she formally launched her career as a writer and lecturer, preaching about the marginalized status of women to increasingly large audiences.</p><p>Over the course of her lifetime, Gilman proved to be enormously prolific, publishing some five hundred poems, nearly two hundred short stories, hundreds of essays, eight novels, and an autobiography. She also emerged as one of the key figures in the late-nineteenth-century women&#x2019;s movement. Her most famous story, &#x201c;The Yellow Wall-Paper,&#x201d; was published in 1892, followed by a book of poetry, <i>In This Our World,</i> a year later. The publication of her landmark feminist treatise <i>Women and Economics</i> (1898) quickly launched Gilman into the spotlight. At the heart of <i>Women and Economics</i> is Gilman&#x2019;s insistence that as long as women were economically dependent on men, they could never reach their full potential as human beings. Translated into seven languages, the book won Gilman international acclaim and established her as <i>the</i> authority on the relationship between female sexual oppression and economic dependence on men.</p><p>With Gilman&#x2019;s public visibility increasing, changes in her personal life were inevitable. The extensive travel and long workdays made it difficult for her to find time for her young daughter. In 1894, she made the agonizing decision to relinquish custody of Katharine to Walter Stetson, whom she divorced the same year. Gilman was publicly condemned for her actions and branded an &#x201c;unnatural&#x201d; mother by her detractors. For his part, Stetson soon married Gilman&#x2019;s long-time friend, Grace Ellery Channing. With Katharine back East with Stetson and his new wife, Gilman resumed her work with renewed vigor.</p><p>During her early years in California, Gilman read Edward Bellamy&#x2019;s socialist-utopian romance, <i>Looking Backward</i> (1888). She was drawn to Bellamy&#x2019;s emphasis on political, social, and economic equality and quickly became a convert to Nationalism, the movement spawned by Bellamy&#x2019;s novel. Based on the principles of reform Darwinism, Nationalism reflected a belief in environmental determinism and embraced the view that society would evolve peacefully and progressively. It also promoted an end to capitalism and class distinctions and advanced the idea of the democratic improvement of the human race. Gilman was particularly attracted by the novel&#x2019;s emphasis on women&#x2019;s rights and began actively advocating such social reforms as economic independence, the restructuring of the home and child-care practices&#x2014;based in part on &#x201c;social motherhood&#x201d; (a system that would enlist the skills of highly trained child-care professionals)&#x2014;and dress reform, all themes that would recur in her fictional utopias years later, most notably in <i>Herland.</i></p><p>In 1900, thirty-nine-year-old Charlotte Stetson married her first cousin, George Houghton Gilman, a Wall Street attorney. The couple settled in New York, and Gilman continued to write and lecture, often embarking on national lecture tours. In 1909, finding it increasingly difficult to secure an audience for her progressive views, she began her own monthly magazine, the <i>Forerunner,</i> which enjoyed a seven-year run. Like nearly all of her writing, the <i>Forerunner</i> was primarily didactic and featured short stories, serialized novels, essays, articles, fables and fantasies, satires ...</p></p><h2>The Stars Are Legion</h2><p><b>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Science Fiction and Fantasy Selection of 2017 </b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;[A] thought-provoking space opera.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;One of the most unusual and powerfully disturbing space operas we&#x2019;re likely to see this year.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i> </b><br> <br>Set within a system of decaying world-ships travelling through deep space, this breakout novel of epic science fiction follows a pair of sisters who must wrest control of their war-torn legion of worlds&#x2014;and may have to destroy everything they know in order to survive.<br><br>Somewhere on the outer rim of the universe, a mass of decaying world-ships known as the Legion is traveling in the seams between the stars.

A PERSON WITHOUT MEMORY IS FREE TO DO ANYTHING SHE LIKES.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;LORD MOKSHI, ANNALS OF THE LEGION<br> 1<p></p> ZAN<p></p> <br>I remember throwing away a child.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the only memory I know for certain is mine. The rest is a gory blackness. All I have, then, are the things I&#x2019;ve been told are true:<br> <br>My name is Zan.<br> <br>I once commanded a great army.<br> <br>My mission was to destroy a world that does not exist.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m told my army was scattered, or eaten, or blown apart into a thousand twinkling bits of debris, and I went missing.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I&#x2019;d ever want to lead an army&#x2014;especially a losing one&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m told I spent my life pushing hard to get to the rank and skill I attained. And when I came back, spit out by the world or wrenched free of my own will, I came back wrong. What wrong means I don&#x2019;t know yet, only that it&#x2019;s also resulted in my lack of memory.<br> <br>The first face I see when I wake each period in my sickbed is full-lipped and luminous, like looking into the face of some life-giving sun. The woman says her name is Jayd, and it is she who has told me all I know to be true. When I ask, now, why there is a dead body on the floor behind her, she only smiles and says, &#x201c;There are many bodies on the world,&#x201d; and I realize the words for world and ship are nearly identical. I don&#x2019;t know which she used.<br> <br>I drift.<br> <br>When I wake next, the body is gone, and Jayd is bustling around me. She helps me sit up for the first time. I marvel at the dark bruises on the insides of my arms and legs. A broad scar cuts my belly in two, low near my groin, and there is something strange about my left hand; it&#x2019;s clearly smaller than the right. When I try to make a fist, it closes only halfway, like a tortured claw. When I slide to the floor, I discover that the bottoms of my feet are mostly numb. Jayd does not give me time to examine them as she pulls a porous, draping robe over my shoulders. It&#x2019;s the same cut and heft as hers, only dark green to her blue.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for your first debriefing,&#x201d; Jayd says as I try to make sense of my injuries. She takes my hand and leads me from the room, down a dark, pulsing corridor. I squint. I see that our entwined hands are the same tawny color, but her skin is much softer than mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were gone for a half-dozen turns,&#x201d; she says, and she sits me down beside her in a room off the corridor. I stare at my palms, trying to open and close my hands. If I work at it, I can get the left to close a bit more. The room, like the corridors, is a warm, glistening space with walls that throb like a beating heart. Jayd smooths the dark hair from my brow with comforting fingers, the movement as reverent and well practiced as a prayer.<br> <br>&#x201c;We thought you dead,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;recycled.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Recycled into what?&#x201d; I say, but the wall blooms open, the door unfurling like a flower, and an older woman beckons us inside, and Jayd ignores my question.<br> <br>Jayd and I go after her and sit on a damp bench on one side of the great plain of a table. The woman sits across from us. Patterns move over the surface of the table, though whether they are writing or purely decorative or something else entirely, I don&#x2019;t know. The more I look at them, the more my head throbs. I touch my temple, only to find that my fingers come away sticky with viscous lubricant or salve. I trace my finger along the ridge of a long scar that runs from the edge of my left brow to the curl of my left ear. I have still not seen my own face. I have encountered no reflective surfaces. There is indeed something very wrong here, but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Gavatra,&#x201d; the older woman says, her voice a low rumble. Her black hair is shorn short against her dark scalp, revealing four long scars like scratch marks on the side of her head. She wears a long, durable garment of shiny blue fabric, like something excreted from the walls. It&#x2019;s all held together with intricate knotted ties. She peers into my face and sighs. &#x201c;Do you know who you are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jayd says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the same as all the other times.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Other times?&#x201d; I say, because how many times can one lose an army and get eaten by a ship and come back with injuries like these and live?<br> <br>Jayd gazes deeply into my eyes, desperately searching my face for something. She has a broad, intense face with sunken eyes, and a bold beak of nose. I feel I should know or understand something from her look, but my memory is a hot, sticky void. I intuit nothing. I flex my hands again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eight hundred and six of your sisters have tried to board the Mokshi,&#x201d; Gavatra says, tapping her fingers across the surface of the table. The patterns change, and she scrutinizes them as if scrying. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one who ever comes out, Zan. This appears to be why Lord Katazyrna keeps sending you there, despite the fact that you&#x2019;ve never successfully led an army inside. Only yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Mokshi,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;The world that doesn&#x2019;t exist?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Jayd says. &#x201c;You remember?&#x201d; Hopeful or doubtful?<br> <br>I shake my head. The phrase means nothing to me. It has simply surfaced. &#x201c;How many times has this happened to me?&#x201d; I say. My left hand trembles, and I gaze at it as if it belongs to someone else. It occurs to me that maybe it once did, and that chills me. I want to know what&#x2019;s happened to my memory, and why there was a body on the floor in my sick room, and why I threw away a child. But I know they aren&#x2019;t going to be pretty answers.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are blessed of the War God, sister mine,&#x201d; Jayd says, but she is looking at Gavatra as she says it. It&#x2019;s like being a child again, stuck in a room with people who have a deep history between them; too deep and complicated for a child to fathom. Even more curious is that if Jayd is really my sister, then the feeling that stirs my gut when she twines her fingers in my hair is entirely wrong.<br> <br>I lift my gaze to Gavatra and firm my jaw. A grim purpose fills me. &#x201c;I wish to know what happened to me,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You can tell me or have me wrest it from you.&#x201d; I can make both hands into fists now. That action feels more natural than anything I&#x2019;ve done so far.<br> <br>Gavatra barks out a laugh. She swipes at the table and pulls a nest of dancing lights from its surface and into the air. I watch them tangle above her, fascinated. She swipes them back onto another part of the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re fulfilling your duty to your mother, the Lord of Katazyrna,&#x201d; Gavatra says, &#x201c;as are we all. But perhaps Jayd is right this time. Perhaps it&#x2019;s time we retire you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel you owe me a memory,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then you must retake the Mokshi,&#x201d; Gavatra says. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have your memory here. That ship ate it. It seems to eat it every time. You want your memory, you take the Mokshi . . . and get a squad in there with you this time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will go again, then,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother can&#x2019;t afford to risk another squad,&#x201d; Jayd says, &#x201c;not with the Bhavajas lying in wait for us in orbit around the Mokshi. The Bhavajas have taken another ship since you&#x2019;ve been gone, Zan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a Bhavaja?&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>Gavatra rolls her eyes. &#x201c;These cycles get tiring,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;They are the greatest enemy of our family,&#x201d; Jayd says. &#x201c;A family we have been feuding with since Mother was a child. It&#x2019;s only a matter of time before they take the Mokshi out from under us too. Maybe even all the Katazyrna ships.&#x201d; This time, I am sure she says ship and not world, because taking an entire world seems impossible.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Mokshi has destroyed a good many people,&#x201d; Gavatra says. &#x201c;Your mother will just steal more from some other distressed world. If Zan is ready to assault the Mokshi again, I won&#x2019;t deny her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jayd slumps in her chair, defeated. Am I something to be fought over and won? &#x201c;This is a foolish enterprise,&#x201d; Jayd says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just as likely that Zan will die as it is she&#x2019;ll retrieve her memory. Some of it comes back without you going to the Mokshi, Zan. If you stay&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say. I press my finger against the long ridge of the scar on my face again. &#x201c;I would like to finish what&#x2019;s been started.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gavatra waves her hand over the table, and the patterns of light fade, revealing the table surface for what it is: a smooth, stitched-together canvas of human skin.<br> <br>I jerk up from the bench. The trembling in my arm becomes a spasm, and I lash out and smash the wall. The wall gives under my fist, as if I&#x2019;ve mashed it into a lung. When I pull my hand away, it is moist. My body begins to shake; my breath comes hard and fast.<br> <br>Jayd wraps her arms around me. &#x201c;Hush, it will pass,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>I feel as if I&#x2019;m watching my body from a great height, unable to contain or control it. The panic is a monstrous thing. My body is trying to fight or flee, and I can&#x2019;t allow it to do either until I understand what&#x2019;s happening here. The attack is so sudden, so consuming, that it terrifies me.<br> <br>Gavatra snorts and stands. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going to pop again,&#x201d; Gavatra says, and she scratches at the scars on her head.<br> <br>My heart hammers loudly in my chest. A dark and twisted impulse seizes me; an uncoiling of everything I have held back while pushed and prodded in my sick room.<br> <br>I leap across the table and take Gavatra by the throat. We collide with the wall and fall into a tangle on the floor. Gavatra writhes beneath me, gasping like a dying woman, and perhaps she is. As I straddle her and look at my hands, I fear my weaker left is not up to the task of strangling a woman to death.<br> <br>I bare my teeth at Gavatra. &#x201c;I do not believe a word of what you have told me,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>Gavatra twists my weaker arm. Pain rushes through me, blinding my panic. She head-butts me in the face, so fast and unexpected that I reel back in shock as much as pain, clutching at my face as blackness judders across my vision.<br> <br>Jayd rushes between me and Gavatra. She slides across the floor to wrap me again in her arms, as if I am a prize animal gone feral.<br> <br>Gavatra uses the table to lever herself up. She rubs at her throat and gives a wry grin. &#x201c;Perhaps there is something of the old Zan in this one,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;My memory!&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;You fool,&#x201d; Gavatra says. &#x201c;You have no idea what a gift that loss is for you.&#x201d; And then Gavatra smiles, her wrinkles deepening, her face cavernous in the dim light. &#x201c;The truth is worse than you can possibly imagine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get me out of here,&#x201d; I say. The panic is subsiding now, but the pulsing walls feel closer, as if the room itself is going to swallow me whole.<br> <br>Jayd presses her cheek to mine. I take a fistful of her hair and squeeze gently. &#x201c;Who are you, really?&#x201d; I whisper.<br> <br>I feel her mouth turn up at the corners. &#x201c;I am your sister, Zan mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>And I smile in turn because my face is throbbing, and a trickle of blood runs from my nose, and I remember my other injuries. I have two choices here: to fight them and risk being recycled&#x2014;whatever that is&#x2014;or to go along with it, to give them what they want, and figure out where my memory has really gone and why these people are going to so much trouble to pretend I am their kin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; I say, and that is partly the truth. I am afraid of what I am going to have to do to this person who claims she is my sister, but who I want to take into my arms and fuck until the world ends.</p><h2>Autumn Bouquet: Patchwork and Appliqu� Quilts from Reproduction Prints</h2><p><p>This collection of dreamy quilts bursts with fabrics from the scrap basket!

Seeming to have come out of nowhere to dominate the discussion-from permaculture to renewable energy to the local food movement-the ideas that underlie and define sustainability can be traced back several centuries.<br><br>In this illuminating and fascinating primer, Jeremy L. Caradonna does just that, approaching sustainability from a historical perspective and revealing the conditions that gave it shape. Locating the underpinnings of the movement as far back as the 1660s, Caradonna considers the origins of sustainability across many fields throughout Europe and North America. Taking us from the emergence of thoughts guiding sustainable yield forestry in the late 17th and 18th centuries, through the challenges of the Industrial Revolution, the birth of the environmental movement, and the emergence of a concrete effort to promote a balanced approach to development in the latter half of the 20th century, he shows that while sustainability draws upon ideas of social justice, ecological economics, and environmental conservation, it is more than the sum of its parts and blends these ideas together into a dynamic philosophy. <br><br>Caradonna's book broadens our understanding of what "sustainability" means, revealing how it progressed from a relatively marginal concept to an ideal that shapes everything from individual lifestyles, government and corporate strategies, and even national and international policy. For anyone seeking understand the history of those striving to make the world a better place to live, here's a place to start.<br></p><p><br>Jeremy L. Caradonna is Associate Professor of History at the University of Alberta. He is the author of <em>The Enlightenment in Practice</em>.<br><br>"A superb survey of the most important concept of the 21st century. Thoughtful, cogent, and essential reading." --David W. Orr, Oberlin College, author of <em>Down to the Wire</em> <br><p></p><br>"Caradonna rapidly traces a thread through centuries of thinkers and political movements. Along the way he ably documents the fact that interest in environmental quality has grown over the last three centuries and that government has as often been used to undermine environmental quality as to support it." --<em>EH.Net</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Functions and Graphs (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>The second in a series of systematic studies by a celebrated mathematician I. M. Gelfand and colleagues, this volume presents students with a well-illustrated sequence of problems and exercises designed to illuminate the properties of functions and graphs. Since readers do not have the benefit of a blackboard on which a teacher constructs a graph, the authors abandoned the customary use of diagrams in which only the final form of the graph appears; instead, the book&#39;s margins feature step-by-step diagrams for the complete construction of each graph. The first part of the book employs simple functions to analyze the fundamental methods of constructing graphs. The second half deals with more complicated and refined questions concerning linear functions, quadratic trinomials, linear fractional functions, power functions, and rational functions.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<p>"All through both volumes [Functions &amp; Graphs and The Methods of Coordinates], one finds a careful description of the step-by-step thinking process that leads up to the correct definition of a concept or to an argument that clinches in the proof of a theorem. We are ... very fortunate that an account of this caliber has finally made it to printed pages... Anyone who has taken this guided tour will never be intimidated by n ever again... High school students (or teachers) reading through these two books would learn an enormous amount of good mathematics. More importantly, they would also get a glimpse of how mathematics is done." </p> <p><strong>-- H.

And what about the clever few who carry out what appears to be the perfect crime? Or whose most essential selves are changed by the crimes they commit? And what about those who know the identity of the murderer but keep the information to themselves? These are some of the questions that these six stories begin to unlock as they draw us into the inner workings&#x2014;the thoughts and emotional machinations, the recollections and rationalizations, the dreams and desires&#x2014;behind both murderous cause and effect. And no one gets inside the head of a perpetrator&#x2014;or makes it a peerlessly thrilling and entertaining read&#x2014;like the incomparable P. D. James.</p><p>P. D. James&nbsp;was the author of twenty-one books, many of which feature her detective hero Adam Dalgliesh and have been televised or filmed. She was the recipient of many honors, including the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and the National Arts Club Medal of Honor for Literature. In 1991 she was created Baroness James of Holland Park. She died in 2014 at the age of ninety-four.The Yo-�Yo<br><br>I found the yo-�yo the day before Christmas Eve, in the way one does come across these long-��forgotten relics of the past, while I was tidying up some of the unexamined papers which clutter my elderly life. It was my seventy-�third birthday and I suppose I was overtaken by a fit of memento mori. Most of my affairs were tidied up years ago, but there is always a muddle somewhere. Mine was in six old box files on a top shelf of the wardrobe in my little-�used spare bedroom, normally out of sight and out of mind. But now, for no particular reason, they intruded into my thoughts with an irritating persistence. Their contents ought to be sorted through and the papers either filed or destroyed. Henry and Margaret, my son and daughter-�in-�law, would expect to find that I, the most meticulous of fathers, had spared them even this minor inconvenience on my death. There was nothing else I needed to do. I was waiting, suitcase packed, for Margaret to come in the car to collect me for a family Christmas I would infinitely have preferred to spend alone in my Temple flat. To collect me. That is what we can so easily be made to feel at seventy-�three; an object, not exactly precious but likely to be brittle, to be carefully collected, conscientiously cared for and as conscientiously returned. I was ready too early, as I always am. There were nearly two hours to be got through before the car arrived. Time to sort out the boxes.<br><br>The box files, bulging and one with the lid wrenched loose, were tied with thin cord. Undoing this and opening the first box, I was met by a half-�forgotten, nostalgic smell of old papers. I carried the box to the bed, settled down and began leafing through a miscellany of papers from my prep-�school days, old school reports&#x2014;�some of the inked comments yellowing, others as clear as if written yesterday&#x2014;�letters from my parents still in their fragile envelopes, with the foreign stamps torn away to give to school-�friend collectors, one or two school exercise books with highly marked essays which I had probably kept to show my parents on their next furlough. Lifting one of these, I discovered the yo-�yo. It was just as I remembered it, bright red, glossy, tactile and desirable. The string was neatly wound with only the looped end for the finger showing. My hand closed round the smooth wood. The yo-�yo precisely �fitted my palm. It felt cold to the touch, even to my hand which is now seldom warm. And with that touch the memories came flooding back. The verb is trite but accurate; they came like a full tide, sweeping me back to the same day sixty years ago, December&nbsp;23rd 1936, the day of the murder.<br><br>I was at prep school in Surrey and was, as usual, to spend Christmas with my widowed grandmother in her small manor house in west Dorset. The rail journey was tedious, requiring two changes, and there was no local station, so she usually sent her own car and driver to collect me. But this year was different. The head�master called me into his study to explain.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had this morning a telephone call from your grandmother, Charlcourt. It appears that her chauffeur is unwell and will be unable to fetch you. I&#x2019;ve arranged for Carter to drive you down to Dorset in my personal car. I need him until after lunch so it will be a later arrival than usual. Lady Charlcourt has kindly offered him a bed for the night. And Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass will be travelling with you. Lady Charlcourt has invited him to spend Christmas at the manor, but no doubt she has already written to you about that.&#x201d;<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t, but I didn&#x2019;t say so. My grandmother wasn&#x2019;t fond of children and tolerated me more from family feeling&#x2014;�I was, after all, like her only son, the necessary heir&#x2014;�than from any affection. She did her dutiful best each Christmas to see that I was kept reasonably happy and out of mischief. There was a suffi�ciency of toys appropriate to my sex and age, purchased by her chauffeur on written suggestions from my mother, but there was no laughter, no young companionship, no Christmas decorations and no emotional warmth. I suspected that she would much have preferred to spend Christmas alone than with a bored, restless and discontented child. I don&#x2019;t blame her. I have reached her age and I feel exactly the same.<br><br>But as I closed the door of the headmaster&#x2019;s study my heart was heavy with resentment and disgust. Didn&#x2019;t she know anything about me or the school? Didn&#x2019;t she realise that the holiday would be boring enough without the sharp eyes and sarcastic tongue of Mike the Menace? He was easily the most unpopular master in the school, pedantic, over-�strict and given to that biting sarcasm which boys find more difficult to bear than shouted insults. I know now that he was a brilliant teacher. It was to Mike the Menace that I largely owe my public-�school scholarship. Perhaps it was this knowledge and the fact that he had been at Balliol with my father which had prompted my grandmother&#x2019;s invitation. My father might even have written to suggest it. I was less surprised that Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass had accepted. The comfort and excellent food at the manor would be a welcome change from the spartan living and institutional cooking at school.<br><br>The journey was as boring as I had expected. When the elderly Hastings was at the wheel, he would let me sit in the front seat beside him and keep me happy with chat about my father&#x2019;s childhood; instead, I was closeted in the back with a silent Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass. The glass partition between us and the driver was closed and all I could see was the back of the rigid uniform hat, which the headmaster always insisted that Carter should wear when acting as chauffeur, and his gloved hands on the wheel.<br><br>Carter wasn&#x2019;t really a chauffeur but was required to drive the headmaster when his prestige demanded this addition to his status. For the rest of the time Carter was part groundsman, part odd-�job man. His wife, frail and gentle-�faced and looking as young as a girl, was matron at one of the three boarding houses. His son, Timmy, was a pupil at the school. Only later did I fully understand this curious arrangement. Carter was what I had overheard one of the parents describe as &#x201c;a most superior type of man.&#x201d; I never knew what personal misfortune had brought him to his job at the school. The headmaster got Carter&#x2019;s and his wife&#x2019;s services cheaply by offering them accommodation and free education for their son. He probably paid them a pittance. If Carter resented this, we, the boys, never knew. We got used to seeing him about the grounds, tall, white-�faced, dark-�haired, and, when not busy, playing always with the red yo-�yo. It was a fashionable toy in the 1930s and Carter was adept at the spectacular throws which the rest of us practised with our own �yo-�yos but never achieved.<br><br>Timmy was an undersized, delicate, nervous child. He sat always at the back of the class, neglected and ignored. One of the boys, a more egregious snob than the rest of us, said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why we have to have that creep Timmy in class with us. That&#x2019;s not why my father pays the fees.&#x201d; But the rest of us didn&#x2019;t mind one way or the other, and in Mike the Menace&#x2019;s class Timmy was a positive asset, diverting from the rest of us the terror of that sharp, sarcastic tongue. I don&#x2019;t think in Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass&#x2019;s case the cruelty had anything to do with snobbery, or even that he recognised his behaviour as cruel. He was simply unable to tolerate wasting his teaching skills on an unresponsive and unintelligent boy.<br><br>But none of this occupied my mind on the journey. Sitting well apart from Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass in the corner of the car, I was sunk in a reverie of resentment and despair. My companion preferred to be driven in darkness as well as silence, and we had no light. But I had brought with me a paperback and a slender torch and asked him if it would disturb him if I read. He replied, &#x201c;Read, by all means, boy,&#x201d; and sank back into the collar of his heavy tweed coat.<br><br>I took out my copy of Treasure Island and tried to concentrate on the small moving pool of light. Hours passed. We were driven through small towns and villages, and it was a relief from boredom to look out at brightly lit streets, the decorated gaudy windows of the shops and the busy stream of late shoppers. In one village a little group of carol singers accompanied by a brass band were jangling their collecting boxes. The sound seemed to follow us as we left the brightness behind. We seemed to be travelling through a dark eternity. I was, of course, familiar with the route, but Hastings normally called for me in the morning of December&nbsp;23rd so that we did most of the drive in daylight. Now, sitting beside that silent figure in the gloom of the car and with blackness pressing against the windows like a heavy blanket, the journey seemed interminable. Then I sensed that we were climbing, and soon I could hear the distant rhythmic thudding of the sea. We must be on the coast road. It would not be long now. I shone my torch on the face of my wristwatch. Half past five. We should be at the manor in less than an hour.<br><br>And then Carter slowed the car and bumped gently onto the grass verge. The car stopped. He pulled back the glass partition and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Sir. I need to get out. A call of nature.&#x201d;<br><br>The euphemism made me want to giggle. Mr. Michaelmass hesitated for a moment, then said, &#x201c;In that case we&#x2019;d better all get out.&#x201d;<br><br>Carter came round and punctiliously opened the door. We stepped out onto lumpy grass, and into black darkness and the swirl of snow. The sea was no longer a background murmur but a crashing tumult of sound. I was at first aware of nothing but the snowflakes on my cheeks, the two dark figures close to me, the utter blackness of the night and the keen salty tang of the sea. Then, as my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, I could see the shape of a huge rock to my left.<br><br>Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass said, &#x201c;Go behind that boulder, boy. Don&#x2019;t take long. And don&#x2019;t go wandering off.&#x201d;<br><br>I stepped closer to the boulder, but not behind it, and the two figures moved out of sight, Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass walking straight ahead and Carter to the right. A minute later, turning from the rock face, I could see nothing, not the car or either of my companions. It would be wise to wait until one of them reappeared. I plunged my hand into my pocket and, almost without thinking, took out the torch and shone it over the headland. The beam of light was narrow but bright. And in that moment, instantaneously, I saw the act of murder.<br><br>Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass was standing very still about thirty yards away, a dark shape outlined against the lighter sky. Carter must have moved up silently behind him on the thin carpet of snow. Now, in that second when the dark figures were caught in the beam, I saw Carter violently lunge forward, arms outstretched, and seemed to feel in the small of my back the strength of that fatal push. Without a sound Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass disappeared from view. There had been two shadowy figures; now there was one.<br><br>Carter knew that I had seen; how could he help it? The beam of light had been too late to stop the action, but now he turned and it shone full on his face. We were alone together on the headland. Curiously I felt absolutely no fear. I suppose that what I did feel was surprise. We moved towards each other almost like automata. I said, hearing the note of simple wonder in my voice, &#x201c;You pushed him over. You murdered him.&#x201d;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I did it for the boy. God help me, I did it for Timmy. It was him or the boy.&#x201d;<br><br>I stood for a moment silently regarding him, aware again of the soft liquid touch of the snow melting on my cheeks. I shone the torch down and saw that the two sets of footprints were already no more than faint smudges on the snow. Soon they would be obliterated under that white blanket. Then, still without speaking, I turned and we walked back to the car together, almost companionably, as if nothing had happened, as if that third person was walking by our side. I have a memory, but perhaps I may be wrong, that at one place Carter seemed to stumble and I held his arm to steady him. When we reached the car he said, his voice dull and without hope, &#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. What is there to do? He slipped and fell over the cliff. We weren&#x2019;t there. We didn&#x2019;t see, either of us. You were with me at the time. We were both together by that rock. You never left my side.&#x201d;<br><br>He said nothing for the moment, and when he did speak I had to strain my ears to hear.<br><br>&#x201c;I planned it, God help me. I planned it, but it was fate. If it was meant to be, then it would be.&#x201d;<br><br>The words meant little at the time, but later, when I was older, I think I understood what he was saying. It was one way, perhaps the necessary way, to absolve himself from responsibility. That push hadn&#x2019;t been the overwhelming impulse of the moment. He had planned the deed, had chosen the place and the time. He knew exactly what he meant to do. But so much had been outside his control. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure that Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass would want to leave the car, or that he would stand so conveniently close to the edge of the cliff. He couldn&#x2019;t be sure that the darkness would be so absolute or that I would stand sufficiently apart. And one thing had worked against him; he hadn&#x2019;t known about my torch. If the attempt had failed, would he have tried again? Who can know? It was one of the many questions I never asked him.<br><br>He opened the rear door for me, suddenly standing upright, a deferential chauffeur doing his job. As I got in I turned and said, &#x201c;We must stop at the first police station and let them know what has happened. Leave the talking to me. And we&#x2019;d better say that it was Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass, not you, who wanted to stop the car.&#x201d;<br><br>I look back now with some disgust at my childish arrogance. The words had the force of a command. If he resented it he made no sign. And he did leave the talking to me, merely quietly confirming my story. I told it first at the police station in the small Dorset town which we reached within fifteen minutes. Memory is always disjointed, episodic. Some impulse of the mind presses the button and, like a colour transparency, the picture is suddenly thrown on the screen, vivid, immobile, a glowing instant fixed in time between the long stretches of dark emptiness. At the police station I remember a tall lamp with the snowflakes swirling out of darkness to die like moths against the glass, a huge coal fire in a small office which smelt of furniture polish and coffee, a Sergeant, huge, imperturbable, taking down the details, the heavy oilskin capes of the policemen as they stamped out to begin the search. I had decided precisely what I would say.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr.&nbsp;Michaelmass told Carter to stop the car and we got out. He said it was a call of nature. Carter and I went to the left by a large boulder and Mr. Michaelmass walked ahead. It was so dark we didn&#x2019;t see him after that. We both waited for him, I suppose for about five minutes, but he still didn&#x2019;t appear. Then I took out my torch and we explored. We could just see his footsteps to the edge of the cliff but they were getting very faint. We still hung around and called, but he didn&#x2019;t reappear, so we knew what had happened.&#x201d;<br><br>The Sergeant ...</p><h2>Six Silent Men, Book Two (101st LRP Rangers)</h2><p>In the summer of 1967, the good old days were ending for the hard-core 1st Brigade LRRPs of the 101st Airborne Division, perhaps the finest maneuver element of its size in the history of the United States Army. It was a bitter pill. After working on their own in Vietnam for more than two years, the Brigade LRRPs were ordered to join forces with the division once again.<br><br>But even as these formidable hunters and killers were themselves swallowed up by the Screaming Eagles' Division LRPs to eventually become F Co., 58th Infantry, they continued the deadly, daring LRRP tradition. From saturation patrols along the Laotian border to near-suicide missions and compromised positions in the always dangerous A Shau valley, the F/58th unflinchingly faced death every day and became one of the most highly decorated companies in the history of the 101st.</p><p>Kenn Miller is a former LRRP and 101st Ranger veteran. He is author of the successful and well-received novel Tiger: The LURP Dog. He lives in Southern California.Chapter One<br> &nbsp;<br> In the early summer of 1967, shortly after the cadre of the 101st Airborne Division&#x2019;s famed Recondo School returned to Fort Campbell from training cadets at West Point, Brigadier General Frank B. Clay, the assistant division commander, and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Beckwith, the division G-2, paid an unexpected visit to the school, bearing the news that General Westmoreland had ordered all the divisions and separate brigade-size maneuver units then conducting operations in Vietnam to organize long-range patrol (LRP, pronounced &#x201c;Lurp&#x201d;) companies. Since the 101st Airborne Division was scheduled to join its 1st Brigade in Vietnam at the end of the year, it was to organize such a company within the division. And though there was no shortage of talent in the division, it seemed only natural that the Recondo School cadre become the nucleus of this new company.<br> &nbsp;<br> General Clay&#x2019;s visit was brief, but after his departure, Lieutenant Colonel Beckwith remained behind to go over some of the details. Having previously commanded the 5th Special Forces Group&#x2019;s Project Delta, Colonel Beckwith was more than familiar with the organization and duties of a long-range patrol company. And as he was the G-2, such a company, at least in theory, would be working for him. Wasting little time, Beckwith had already made up his mind to put the new company under the command of Captain Peter Fitts. Fitts, a mustang officer with plenty of enlisted time (and an array of tattoos to prove that most of his service had been as an enlisted man), had a prior tour in Vietnam establishing and running long-range recon teams for Special Forces.<br> &nbsp;<br> Colonel Beckwith knew what he wanted. The Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) called for a three-platoon company. Two of the platoons would be patrol platoons, each running four to five six-man reconnaissance teams. The third platoon would be a headquarters platoon with a strong communications section. Beckwith made it very clear to the gathered Recondo School cadre that the company was to be a volunteer unit with standards that would exclude all but the most qualified. There was no disagreement.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Beckwith had taken over Project Delta, it had been with the understanding that he would be given free rein to hire and fire anyone he wanted and that 5th Special Forces Group&#x2019;s entire roster would be open for recruiting his people. In taking over Project Delta, Beckwith had made a lot of enemies, stepped on a lot of toes, and maybe wronged a few good men. But then, Charlie Beckwith had never been the kind of man who worried about stepping on toes.<br> &nbsp;<br> He couldn&#x2019;t promise the Recondo cadre they&#x2019;d have carte blanche in putting together the new long-range patrol company, but he did assure them that they&#x2019;d have the right to reject any volunteer who didn&#x2019;t meet their standards.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Beckwith had taken over Project Delta, he&#x2019;d sent notices out to every detachment in the 5th Special Forces Group advertising for volunteers and, as an inducement, promising a medal or a body bag&#x2014;or both. He didn&#x2019;t expect such an appeal would be allowed in the 101st Airborne Division&#x2014;at least not at Fort Campbell. Still, a message of that sort would almost certainly get out to the troops.<br> &nbsp;<br> The new company was going to need mature, experienced, well-trained team leaders and cadre, and Beckwith was quick to suggest that every officer and NCO of the Recondo School staff should volunteer to go back to Vietnam with the new Lurp company. As Sergeant First Class Harold Beck noted afterward, when &#x201c;Chargin&#x2019; Charlie&#x201d; Beckwith made a suggestion, it usually carried the weight of an order. But this was one time Charlie Beckwith could have saved his breath. Every man listening to him had already made up his mind to do just that. To build up a Screaming Eagle Recondo Lurp company and take it to war? Hell, those men were professional Airborne soldiers&#x2014;Rangers, paratroopers, Recondo instructors&#x2014;and this was the opportunity of a lifetime, the sort of prospect that made all the routine, mundane frustration of a military career, and all the sweat, suffering, and apprehension of a paratrooper&#x2019;s life, worthwhile.<br> &nbsp;<br> At that first meeting, it was assumed that the team leaders in the new company would come from the ranks of the Recondo School cadre, all experienced NCOs with the training and experience required of Lurp team leaders. All but one of them was a graduate of the Fort Benning Ranger School&#x2014;and the one who wasn&#x2019;t a Ranger School graduate was Tony Bliss, a genuine hero on his first tour in the 101st&#x2019;s 1st Brigade, Division Soldier of the Year at Fort Campbell, and an honor graduate of the Recondo School. Some of the cadre had served as Ranger instructors, and most of them had previous Vietnam tours in Special Forces or as advisers to Vietnamese units. The TOE of a divisional Lurp company was still a tentative text, but the consensus at the time was that the TOE could probably be stretched to allow E-6 staff sergeant and E-7 sergeant first class team leaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as soon as that first meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Beckwith ended, it became clear that the problem wasn&#x2019;t going to be finding men to lead the teams. It was going to be finding men to fill the teams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recruiting proved to be a formidable task. As the call was passed around to the various units at Fort Campbell, word also reached Fort Bragg, and soon a number of 82nd Airborne paratroopers, and a few idle Green Berets, began to give serious consideration to trying to get over to the 101st to join the new long-range patrol company. But since there wasn&#x2019;t much guarantee that they wouldn&#x2019;t be sent to a line infantry company instead&#x2014;or even worse, get stuck in some damn support or headquarters unit&#x2014;most of them decided at the last minute to stay where they were.<br> &nbsp;<br> One man from Fort Bragg who decided to take the chance was Sp4 Jim Venable. He had been stuck driving a truck for the 82nd&#x2019;s support command, and he hadn&#x2019;t gone Airborne to drive a deuce and a half. Venable was on his way up to Brigade Headquarters as a candidate for Brigade Soldier of the Month when he was waylaid by a couple of Special Forces NCOs, who told him about a &#x201c;special&#x201d; company some friends of theirs were putting together up at Fort Campbell. Venable immediately recognized this as an escape and evasion opportunity. He and a dozen or so other selected 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers, a Special Forces Training Group student medic who&#x2019;d shown great promise until his dog died in the final, &#x201c;dog lab,&#x201d; phase of the medical qualification course, and a very small number of other personnel from Fort Bragg were recruited for the company by friends of the Recondo School cadre.<br> &nbsp;<br> Word also went out to promising privates at the Fort Benning Jump School, though orders couldn&#x2019;t be cut for them to the company, only to the division. Recent graduates of the Fort Benning Ranger School were already spoken for, but somehow Staff Sergeant Richard Burnell, who was already well on his way to becoming a legendary Ranger instructor, was lured away to the 101st and managed to pull strings to secure a slot in the new Lurp company.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the main recruiting effort had to go forward within the 101st, and it was not an easy&#x2014;or an altogether successful&#x2014;effort. The 101st Airborne Division had no shortage of paratroopers who wanted to be Lurps, but despite Colonel Beckwith&#x2019;s best efforts, the long-range patrol company itself had no special priority in recruiting. The entire 101st Airborne Division was gearing up to join the 1st Brigade in Vietnam. Unit commanders and senior NCOs were not about to let the Lurps stage raids on their best people. In turn, the Lurps weren&#x2019;t about to let anyone dump a bunch of malcontents, misfits, and duds on them. Sergeant First Class Harold Beck, Staff Sergeant Tony Bliss, and Staff Sergeant Donald Randolph made many forays to the division&#x2019;s replacement companies, getting the word out that the division was looking for Lurp volunteers. Despite their best efforts to recruit new arrivals &#x201c;before&#x201d; they were assigned to other units, they did not have the power to expedite getting orders cut. If a man was already pending orders assigning him to another unit within the division, there wasn&#x2019;t much an E-7 and two E-6s could do to get those orders changed. And even though the company had two captains&#x2014;Captain Fitts, the commander, and Captain Nation, the executive officer&#x2014;there wasn&#x2019;t much they could do about it either, because they were going against the staffs of majors, colonels both light and bird, and in some cases even generals, one star or two. Even Lieutenant Colonel Beckwith was in no position to compel compliance on the part of officers who didn&#x2019;t want to lose their best men on the eve of departure for a combat zone.<br> &nbsp;<br> One by one, volunteers did drift in. It was a slow and grueling process, and the long-range patrol company remained severely understrength. With the entire division making final preparations for war, the Lurp company found that its low-priority status for training was no better than its low-priority status for recruiting. Fortunately, the new company did have the Recondo School, and it retained the same access to training sites as any other infantry company, albeit without the support resources the other companies enjoyed. But the Recondo School and the normal training sites on post were not enough to train Lurps, and as summer turned to fall, Colonel Beckwith called in some markers and arranged for the new company to move down to the Florida Ranger camp for a little specialized training.<br> &nbsp;<br> Charlie Beckwith had commanded the Florida Ranger camp before coming to the 101st, and he had some real power there. He laid on some good training&#x2014;and some very nasty weather. Rain was constant, and though the patrolling was usually slow and careful, the pace of training was relentless. It was soon obvious to everyone that not all the Recondo School cadre were going to be team leaders. A couple of them weren&#x2019;t really cutting it in the field, while a couple of the new recruits had both the rank and the talent to qualify for the job.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a sadly understrength company that made the trip down to Florida, just a cadre, and enough new sergeants and Sp4s and PFCs to fill out three or four full six-man teams. There was some talk about reducing team size to four men, but no one wanted to scrap the TOE of a divisional long-range patrol company before it was even completed. Besides, there were still not enough experienced men to go around on the teams, no matter how you split them up and shuffled them around&#x2014;not if the intention was to field as many teams as a division as large and aggressive as the 101st Airborne was going to need.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Goodnight Trump: A Parody</h2><p><b>Celebrate impeachment season by saying goodnight to America's man-child-in-chief in this bestselling, wickedly funny parody.</b><br><b><i>Goodnight Trump</i></b> opens in the very classy golden bedroom of the White House, where it is bedtime for the 45th President of the United States.

On the inside, Dr. Jeremy Balint is a high-functioning sociopath--a man who truly believes himself to stand above the ethical norms of society. As long as life treats him well, Balint has no cause to harm others. When life treats him poorly, he reveals the depths of his cold-blooded depravity.<br><br>At a cultural moment when the media bombards us with images of so-called sociopaths who strive for good and criminals redeemed by repentance,<i>The Mask of Sanity</i> offers an antidote to implausible tales of evil gone right. In contrast to fictional predecessors like Dostoyevesky's Raskolnikov and Camus' Meursault, Dr. Balint is a man who already has it all --and will do everything in his power, no matter how immoral, to keep what he has.</p><p>Jacob M.

His short stories have been published in more than 200 journals and have been short-listed for the O.

He's a respected community leader, a cardiologist with a thriving practice and a family man with a beautiful wife and two lovely young daughters. But when he discovers that his wife is having an affair with one of his colleagues, he begins methodically planning to take the man's life. Balint pretends the colleague is his best friend and feigns ignorance of his wife's infidelity. To avoid any hint that he has a motive for murder, he allows the affair to continue for months.He studies murder cases, both real and fictional, to learn how to avoid mistakes, always careful to leave no trace that could lead back to him. Finally, he decides that the best way to avoid being caught is to make it appear that the murder he is planning is just one in a series of random attacks by a deranged serial killer which means he has to kill six or seven times. As Balint begins his rampage, he is somewhat surprised to discover that he can bash and strangle without remorse.<br><br>That's the premise of <i>The Mask of Sanity</i>, a novel that is both a suspenseful yarn and a chilling portrait of the mind of a high-functioning sociopath. The author, Jacob M. Appel, knows his subject well. He is a physician, an attorney and a former Ivy League professor who has made a study of sociopaths. And his crisp, muscular prose comes as no surprise from a prolific short story writer who has been shortlisted for the O'Henry Award and whose first novel, <i>The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up</i>, won the Dundee International Book Prize in 2012." --<b>Associated Press</b><br><br>"Dr. Jeremy Balint, 'the youngest head of any medical division at Laurendale-Methodist Hospital,' discovers his inner psychopath in Appel's deeply unsettling novel set in what might be upstate New York. When Balint discovers that his wife, Amanda, is having an affair with his fellow doctor Warren Sugarman, he feels an overwhelming desire to murder Sugarman, and fulfilling this need soon consumes his otherwise normal life. As the wronged husband, Balint realizes that he'd be the logical suspect no matter how Sugarman dies-unless Sugarman appears to be the random target of a serial killer. So Balint sets out methodically murdering random strangers and tying lengths of green ribbon around their necks. Now known as the Emerald Choker, he takes no pleasure in the killings, but neither do they bother him. Each, after all, brings him closer to his goal of eliminating the detested Sugarman. Through matter-of-fact, nonjudgmental prose, Appel (<i>The Biology of Luck</i>) shows us the world through Balint's eyes and leaves the reader with a horrifying understanding of his actions." --<b>Publishers Weekly</b><br><br>"In <i>The Mask of Sanity</i>, Jacob Appel delves into the mind of a murderer as he plots his version of the perfect crime. Upon learning that his wife is sleeping with one of his colleagues, Dr. Jeremy Balint decides to kill his rival-and to become a serial killer in order to hide his motive. Like its protagonist, the book is tightly focused on the crime, featuring lots of attention to detail and elaborate schemes to keep the outcome unclear. Along with the murders at the heart of the story, Appel gives Balint plenty of secrets to keep: having his own relationship with a woman who doesn't know he's married, working with the man he plans to kill, and hiding from his wife that he knows her secret. There isn't much sense of what Balint was like before discovering the affair, but his sociopathy influences nearly every aspect of his life. This isn't a character trying to overcome his demons, but one fully in league with them, and that keeps <i>The Mask of Sanity</i> moving." --<b>Foreword Reviews</b></p><h2>The House on Maple Street</h2><p><p>What would you see from your front porch if your neighborhood suddenly looked as it did three hundred years ago? When the two girls who live at 107 Maple Street discover an ancient arrowhead and a broken china cup, they begin to wonder.</p></p><p>Bonnie Pryor thoroughly researched important periods of American history for each of her American Adventures. For <em>Luke on the High Seas,</em> she delved into seafaring in the nineteenth century so that the details of Luke Reed's journey would be accurate. She lives in Gambier, Ohio. In Her Own Words...<p></p><p>"I grew up in Spokane, Washington, the middle child in a family of three girls. Books were a part of my life from as far back as I can remember. I was often in trouble for reading at the wrong time. I would be caught reading under the dining room table when I was supposed to be dusting, or reading under the covers by flashlight late at night-even hiding a novel inside my textbooks at school.</p><p>"Not everyone thought I read too much. I remember a school librarian who saved all the new books for me to read first, and on several occasions she gave me presents of books. Perhaps she felt she should because I had read every single thing in her library!</p><p>"I was very shy, and, like Robert in <em>The Plum Tree War</em>, I spent a lot of my time hanging from my knees from a favorite plum tree, telling myself stories. Of course since I was raised in the West these stories were usually about wild horses and cowboys, and I was always the heroine who came to the rescue. The stories were long and involved, sometimes going on for days. I was always impatient to get to my tree each day so I could find out what was going to happen next, but I was too lazy to write the stories down.</p><p>"I think everyone expected me to become a writer, but it took me twenty years and a gentle nudge from my husband, Robert, to build up the courage to try. In the meantime I moved to Ohio, worked at a variety of jobs, and raised a family. I have four grown children, eight grandchildren, and two daughters still at home-Jenny and Chrissy. Many of my books are loosely based upon incidents in my children's lives, and they often appear as characters, in personality if not by name.</p><p>"My family recently moved to the country. When I'm not writing and visiting schools, we're busy building barns and fences and laying out flower beds. In addition, we all take part in caring for the four newcomers to our home: three horses and a bunny!"</p>Grade 1-4 Compressing 300 years of this-is-what-happened incidents at a somewhere-place into the limited text of a picture book takes some doing. The narrator starts with a forest and a spring (hard to draw a spring, so we have a stream), and time travels forward past forest fire, buffalo, Indians, wagon trains, settlers, farmers, down to the contemporary family who live in the house on Maple Street. An arrowhead (for recognition purposes drawn so large as to be a spear point, at least) is a unifying object lost by an Indian boy, found many years later by a little girl, lost again, found by the Maple Street family. The concept is intriguing, but the text lacks clarity. Murky illustrations with wooden figures, full of discrepancies, detract, and the whole will have limited appeal for whatever the targeted reading audience is supposed to be.

The project has now collected over 100,000 testimonies from people around the world and launched new branches in 25 countries worldwide.

She writes regularly for the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Independent</i>, the <i>New Statesman</i>, and <i>Time Magazine</i>. Laura has given TEDx talks, spoken to universities, including Harvard, and even to the House of Lords. She is also contributor at Women Under Siege, a New-York based organisation working to combat the use of sexual violence as a tool of war in conflict zones worldwide. She is the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project.<p>"<i>Everyday Sexism</i> started in the streets, homes and offices of London, and now has spread to thirty countries around the globe&#x2015;for good reason. Daily humiliations have been mostly unreported until now. Such big crimes as sexualized violence in war zones may get noticed, but the death of the spirit is also the death of a thousand cuts. Laura Bates has challenged the normalization of sexism, and created a place where both men and women can see it and change it." &#x2015;Gloria Steinem</p><p>"Readers, whether newly educated or empowered by Bates&#x2019; comprehensive, well-researched report, will find it useful for starting discussions between the genders." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Bates invites provocative, much-needed dialog that will promote more nuanced exchanges regarding the issues women face." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"Laura Bates didn't just begin a movement, she has started a revolution. Women are speaking back and she is giving them the megaphone to do it. Anyone who isn't convinced we live in a world where women are still treated as second class citizens needs to read Everyday Sexism. Women are shouting, and everyone better listen." &#x2015;Liz Plank, Senior Correspondent at Mic and host of Flip the Script </p><p>"Read this book for two reasons: Bates offers a startlingly astute analysis on violence and inequality that breathes much-needed life into what is often tired gender politics. But more than that, she gives space to <i>our</i> voices&#x2015;the voices of those of us who have been grabbed, jeered at, or made to feel invisible. The societal silencing of sexism is what Bates truly upends, and it&#x2019;s this that does a public, and personal, service to thousands and thousands of women around the world who have stood up and finally&#x2015;finally&#x2015;been heard." &#x2015;Lauren Wolfe, journalist and Director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege Project</p><p>"In <i>Everyday Sexism</i>, Laura Bates has created a much needed and important space for people to come forward, share their experiences and understand why they are important. The hundreds of jarring stories she shares in this book are those society would rather continue to pretend don't happen or don't matter. Bates' clear, and critically on-target demand that society pay attention is evident on every page. Her thorough, relentless and accessible approach to difficult and complex issues is catalyzing a global conversation about gender inequality." &#x2015;Soraya Chemaly</p><p>"By documenting story after story of both small and large incidents of sexism in public spaces, homes, schools, workplaces, media, and politics, and by using corroborating data and news articles, Bates has shown just how frequently women face discrimination &#x2015; and the toll it takes. But she also has shown how, as women realize they are not alone or to blame for the sexism, harassment and assault they experience, they begin speaking out and&#x2015; in many cases &#x2015; they successfully challenge the sexist status quo...As more people read her book, undoubtedly more will be inspired to speak out, pushing along the groundswell of outrage and action that will one day result in the end of sexism." &#x2015;Holly Kearl</p><p>"Laura Bates book Everyday Sexism is powerful and very effective.

But I love those books, don't you?"<br><br>"Sometimes I get the Warm Fuzzles, just like the Holy Rollers," Mariah said, and Parker nearly threw up in her mouth. Had she really invented that term? Had she been drinking at the time?<br><br>"Are you rich?" Henry Sloane asked.<br><br>"Well," Parker answered, "if you're asking if I make a lot as an author, the answer is no. All the money I get for the Holy Rollers goes to a charity called Save the Children."<br><br>"That's for kids who don't have enough food," Nicky said proudly, and Parker smiled at her son. It was the one good thing about the book series. Parker didn't need the money, so right from the get-go, she'd donated all proceeds to the charity, which took away some of the nausea.<br><br>"But you live in a mansion," Will Michalski stated with authority. "I've been there. You have twenty-nine bathrooms."<br><br>"True enough," she said, a twinge of discomfort flashing through her.<br><br>"It's a mansion. It's a castle!

Parker might not love the Holy Rollers, but new ideas hadn't exactly been pouring out of her. "I hope so."<br><br>"What's it about?"<br><br>"Um, I'm not quite sure yet. But I'll let you know, okay? Any other questions? Yes, Ben."<br><br>After another half hour, as the questions dwindled into what color wings Golly should have, the teacher finally stepped in.<br><br>"Miss Welles has to get going, I'm sure," she said. "Kids, can you say thank-you to Nicky's mom?"<br><br>"Thank you, Nicky's mom!" the kids chorused, then rushed her, hugging her legs, the payoff for reading <em>The Holy Rollers Earn Their Halos</em> out loud.<br><br>"Am I staying with Daddy this weekend?" Nicky asked as they walked to the car.<br><br>"You sure are," Parker answered. She stroked her son's dark hair. Ethan's weekend had come awfully fast, it seemed. She gave her son a kiss, then bent to buckle him into his booster.<br><br>"I can do it myself," Nicky said.<br><br>"Right. Sorry, honey." She got into the driver's seat and started the car.<br><br>A weekend alone. Parker tried not to sigh. She really needed to find another idea for a series. The Holy Rollers had been born as a spoof, sure, but they'd been her job for the past six years. Aside from staring at a blank computer screen and possibly watching a Gerard Butler movie or three, she had no plans.<br><br>"You should sleep over, too," Nicky suggested, practically reading her mind. "We could have popcorn. Lucy said she's making me a cake."<br><br>"The woman can bake, that's for sure," Parker said. "What kind?"<br><br>"My favorite kind. With the frosting and the coconut. I can eat seven pieces, she said."<br><br>"Did she, Nicky?" Parker cocked an eyebrow. Truth wasn't a strong point for her little guy these days.<br><br>"I think so. She maybe said five. But it was a lot."<br><br>Nicky continued to chatter about the joys that lay ahead of him for the weekend: eating cake; a sail on Ethan's boat; more cake; sleeping with Fat Mikey, Lucy and Ethan's cat; possibly taking a bath with Fat Mikey; having cake at midnight; and finding the pirate's cave that Mackerly, Rhode Island, supposedly possessed. Like his grandmothers, Nicky had been born with the gift of chat.<br><br>As she pulled onto Ocean View Drive, Parker frowned a little. The preschooler's comment about living in a mansion had struck a nerve. Lately, she'd been thinking of moving, concerned over the idea that Nicky would be thought of as the rich kid. It hadn't helped her; trust funds were hard to get past for a lot of people. But Gray-hurst had been in her family for four generations, built by her great-great-grandfather at the turn of the century, and though she'd grown up in New York City, Parker had moved to Mackerly permanently after she'd gotten pregnant. She had a lot of happy memories of childhood summers&#x2014;tea parties with her three cousins, learning to sail with her father. Ethan lived in town, and she'd wanted Nicky to grow up knowing both his parents, even if they'd never been married. But two people, living in a mansion in which they really only used a few rooms...it didn't feel right.<br><br>The place was gorgeous, though, she thought as they pulled into the driveway. Silhouetted against the aching blue of a June sky and bathed in the golden sun of late afternoon, the gray stone building looked like a stately grande dame gazing out contentedly over the acres of manicured lawns, flower beds and mature trees. Frickin' huge, but beautiful.<br><br>Ethan and Lucy, Parker's closest friends, were already here, holding hands as they sat on wide front steps that led from the driveway to the enormous entryway. Ethan jumped up to open her door as she pulled in.<br><br>"Daddy!" Nicky yelled, scrambling out of the car.<br><br>"How's my guy?" Ethan asked, scooping him up.<br><br>"So," Lucy said, "are congratulations in order?"<br><br>"I am officially done with the Holy Rollers. Let the good times roll."<br><br>"Good for you, Parks," Ethan said, kissing Nicky's cheek. "You proud of Mommy, Nick?"<br><br>"Yup. What's for snack? Is cake for snack?"<br><br>"No cake till after supper," Lucy said. "Unless your dad decides otherwise."<br><br>"Decide otherwise, Dad!" Nicky commanded, cantering ahead.<br><br>"Parker, do you have plans tonight?" Lucy asked. "I figured the boys could have some time alone, and we could hang out."<br><br>Saved! "I would love that! We can break open some of my father's wine and gossip about Ethan's flaws all night."<br><br>Lucy reached for his hand. "He's driving me crazy. I'm thinking marriage was a huge mistake."<br><br>"My God, it's like you're reading my mind," Ethan said. "Shall I call an attorney?" They grinned at each other.<br><br>"Guys, I just ate, okay?" Parker said, cocking an eyebrow. The tiniest swirl of envy threaded through her. Lucy and Ethan were crazy in love, and yep, Ethan was the father of Parker's child. It wasn't as freaky as it sounded. Or maybe it was, and Parker was in denial.<br><br>"We brought the itinerary for our trip," Ethan said, standing back to let the ladies go in first. "Figured you'd want a copy."<br><br>"Great!" Parker said firmly. "I'm dying to see it."<br><br>Her friends had gotten married in February, but they hadn't had a honeymoon yet; instead, they were taking Nicky to California as soon as preschool finished. San Francisco, Muir Woods, Yosemite. After that, Ethan would be occupied with the reopening of his restaurant, so the timing seemed perfect.<br><br>It was just that it was for three weeks.<br><br>Three weeks without her boy.<br><br>"Daddy!" Nicky galloped back and grabbed his father's hand. "Come see my room! I cleaned it yesterday. Mommy made me. She said it was a sty. Where pigs live. I found Darth Vader's head!" He tugged his father up the curving staircase.<br><br>Parker and Lucy went through the house to the kitchen, Parker's favorite place in the house. "I brought us sustenance," Lucy said, holding out a bag. "White-chocolate macadamia cookies."<br><br>"Satan, get thee behind me." She took out a cookie&#x2014;heck yeah, still warm!&#x2014;and took a bite. Bliss. "Do you know I've gained eleven pounds since last year? You hit thirty-five, and bam, all those things you ate in your twenties launch themselves onto your ass." Parker raised an eyebrow as Lucy laughed. "You'll see."<br><br>"I already see," her friend said. "So what? You're a size eight now? The horror, the horror."<br><br>"Oh, I hit double digits some time ago. Let's never speak of it again."<br><br>"You bet," Lucy said.<br><br>Marriage agreed with her, Parker thought. Lucy'd had it rough; widowed before her first anniversary years ago. Jimmy, her husband, had been Ethan's older brother; Ethan and Lucy had been college friends; the shared loss brought them closer together. About six years after Jimmy died, Ethan and Lucy had finally hooked up.<br><br>And somewhere in there, long before Ethan and Lucy had anything romantic together, he'd dated Parker for about two months. The guy had been great on paper, save for one minor detail: he'd been in love with Lucy. Parker always thought it funny that more people hadn't seen it. She broke up with him&#x2014;it wasn't terribly hard; they'd already seemed more like old pals than anything&#x2014;then found out six weeks later that she was pregnant. They'd shared Nicky from the beginning.<br><br>She took another cookie out of the bag and ate it. "Holy halos, these are good. Shoot me if I eat another. Where's the itinerary? It's color coded, right? Tell me it's color-coded."<br><br>"Of course it is," Lucy said, unfolding a three-page spreadsheet.<br><br>"So you'll be in San Fran for three days?"<br><br>"Four." Lucy pointed. "See? San Francisco's in pink."<br><br>"Of course." Parker bent over the paper, grateful for Lucy's organizational skills. She'd know where her son was every minute.<br><br>Ethan came into the kitchen and helped himself to a cookie. "Parker, what are your plans while we're away?" he asked. "Got anything lined up?"<br><br>"Oh, I might bop out to Nantucket and see some old pals out there. Go into the city. Maybe visit my mom. You know." She reached for another cookie.<br><br>The truth was, she hadn't made any solid plans. The idea of having her son four <em>thousand</em> miles away made her want to sleep at the airport, in case something went wrong. <em>Which it won't,</em> the Holy Rollers assured her. <em>Lucy and Ethan are the best! Plus, it 'll be good for Nicky to see what a healthy adult relationship looks like!</em><br><br><em>Take a bite,</em> Parker thought. So she hadn't been in a relationship since Ethan. So she'd yet to go on a second date with anyone in five years. So what? She tended to attract emotionally unavailable men, anyway. Married men, engaged men, sociopaths, that sort of thing. Better not to date at all. The fact that she'd spent a lot of time watching gritty TNT dramas and eating Ben &amp; Jerry's should not be construed as jealousy. It was more like a filling of the gap.<br><br>A gap that would now be uninterrupted for three weeks.<br><br>When Ethan broached the vacation idea back in March, it had seemed like a fabulous idea...Parker, on her own, free to do whatever she wanted&#x2014;sleep past 5:00 a.m., for example, as Nicky was like a rooster about mornings. Find that elusive new idea for a book series. Just because Parker had been born with a trust fund didn't mean she wanted to build a life around shopping for handbags.<br><br>But as the spring progressed, she did nothing. What if something happened with Ethan's restaurant, and the trip had to be canceled? What if a new book series came to her, and she was on fire to write it, the way she'd heard other authors describe? She should probably stay home, in case something came up.<br><br>It didn't. And now with ten days to go, the time alone seemed to loom like a mine shaft. She didn't even have the Holy Rollers to keep her busy, and the fact that this even caused a twinge was deeply disturbing.<br><br>"I was hiding! No one found me! I beat you all."<br><br>Nicky charged into the kitchen with Elephant, his favorite stuffed animal.<br><br>"Nicky, you can't hide without telling us, remember?" Parker said. "It's not a game that way."<br><br>"But I always win," her son pointed out.<br><br>"He has a point," Lucy said.<br><br>Parker grinned and knelt down. "Kiss me, mister. I love you."<br><br>"I love you, too. Bye, Mom! Bye, Lucy!" He bolted out of the kitchen.<br><br>"That's my cue. See you, girls. Have fun tonight." Ethan kissed Parker on the cheek, then went out to the foyer with Lucy, where Parker presumed he would kiss her goodbye a little more intensely.<br><br>For a second, she wondered if Lucy was here out of...well...sympathy. Once, she, Ethan and Lucy had been three single friends. Now, instead of three, it was two and one.<br><br><em>So? Get a boyfriend,</em> Golly advised. Since the release of the final book, it seemed to Parker that the Holy Rollers were aging in her imagination. They were depicted in the books as being about eight, but here Golly was already trying on mascara.<br><br>"Right. A boyfriend," Parker answered. "I need that like a stick in the eye."<br><br>She headed down to her father's beloved wine cellar, complete with a stone tasting room&#x2014;fireplace and all. Thousands and thousands of bottles, including the bottle of Chateau Lafite supposedly owned by Thomas Jefferson. Or not. Harry was quite a liar.<br><br>She hadn't seen her father for a while now; the last time was when he'd held a wine-tasting dinner down here with a few sycophants from Wall Street, his omnipresent personal attorney and one of the Kennedy clan, who was up for reelection. Her orders were to bring Nicky down to be introduced, then bring him back upstairs. And stay upstairs with him. Not that she'd have stayed even if asked. Which she wasn't.<br><br>Well. Here was that nice 1994 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Harry had bragged about. Eight grand a bottle, far less than the 1996 vintage. Surely Harry wouldn't mind if his only child and her best friend drank that, right? He had a whole case, after all. She wouldn't tell Lucy how much it cost. Lucy was a little scared of Harry. Most people were.<br><br>Parker went back upstairs, uncorked the wine and let it breathe a little. Got out some goat cheese and grapes, some of those crumbly crackers. It was so great that Lucy had decided to hang out. Maybe too great. <em>You'v...</em></p><h2>The Sublime Quran</h2><p>HRH PRINCE GHAZI BIN MUHAMMAD, CHIEF ADVISOR FOR RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS TO H. M. KING ABDULLAH II, AUTHOR OF LOVE IN THE HOLY QURAN. Those who read translations of the Qur an (and there are no completely accurate translations of the Qur an in English and only a few adequate ones (these being arguably Abdullah Yusuf Ali s; Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall s), Laleh Bakhtiar s translation is arguably the most internally consistent. They are not reading the Qur an, but rather mere subjective individual interpretations of it: the Qur an is God s Word in its Arabic form only. The work Dr. Bakhtiar has put into her interpretation the consistency, the method, the attention to tense, root, case and detail is second to none. I have never seen its like before. The English reading of it is also lovely and smooth. This is clearly a blessing God has blessed her with, ma sha Allah. H.R.H. Prince Ghazi JOHN ESPOSITO, HEAD OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR MUSLIM/CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING. I am very familiar with Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s writings and her recent translation of the Quran. Sublime Quran is a major translation that, in contrast to many other translations, in clear and direct language, effectively makes the message of the Quran accessible to English speaking audiences. It is one that I often recommend. REZA ASLAN, AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED WRITER AND SCHOLAR OF RELIGIONS AND CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT THE DAILY BEAST. I am quite a fan of your mothers and routinely talk about her Quran translation in my speeches and in my classes. Here&#39;s a quote for you: For 14 centuries the translation and interpretation of the Quran has been the sole purview of men. Only men have been empowered to define the meaning and message of the Quran, and it is no coincidence that their interpretation has often been misogynist or worse. Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s incredible achievement has changed all that. For the first time a woman has been able to reengage the scripture from a different point of view, thus producing a gender neutral translation that is far more consistent with the message and spirit of the Quran than any previous translation. REZA ASLAN SHAIDA KHAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC HARMONY FOUNDATION, a non-profit organization working against domestic violence within Muslim, Middle Eastern and South Asian communities (based in Long Island, NY) Laleh was the keynote speaker at their Annual Fundraising Gala on April 17, 2010 in Long Island, NY. There are numerous reasons for the importance of Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s translation of the Holy Quran, the least of which is that her Sublime Quran provides a sensible and humanistic interpretation for the holy book. As the Executive Director of the Domestic Harmony Foundation, a non-profit organization working against domestic violence within Muslim, Middle Eastern and South Asian communities, this interpretation of Ms. Bakhtiar&#39;s is particularly significant. We are often faced with individuals who are victimized by their partners&#39; usage of Quranic verses to further their abusive gains, citing the controversial verse 4-34.</p><p>Laleh Bakhtiar, born of an American mother and Iranian father, grew up in America as a Catholic. At the age of twenty-four she moved to Iran in 1964 with her husband and children, not speaking Persian nor knowing anything about Islam. She began to study Islam with her mentor, Seyyed Hossein Nasr at Tehran University where she also studied Quranic Arabic. She returned to America in 1988 and attended graduate school where she earned her M.A. in Religious Studies, M.A. in Counseling Psychology and Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. She is also a Nationally Certified Counselor, licensed in Illinois and has lectured on Islam at many universities, colleges, churches, temples and synagogues. Through the works on psychology she has become the leading authority on the Sufi integration of the Enneagram. She is leading scholar on the psychology of spiritual chivalry (futuwwa, muruwwa, javanmardi). She directs her work towards Muslim women and youth who, once they learn of this model of spiritual chivalry Islam, become more positive oriented towards their faith and family. SHAIDA KHAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC HARMONY FOUNDATION. Her interpretation provides a more Islamic minded approach- that when all else fails, to move away from - the wife should be the last resort, and not to hit. This meaning is particularly important in our field of work when the victims and the abusers need to be educated as to the real nature of Islamic teachings. Equally as important as Dr. Bakhtiar&#39;s interpretation is the very fact that as a knowledgeable female scholar. She is an exemplary individual particularly for women who have been victimized by domestic violence, and also for all Muslim women to look up to. Shaida Khan INGRID MATTSON, PAST PRESIDENT THE ISLAMIC SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA AND PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES HARTFORD SEMINARY. Current events have left Americans fascinated and frightened by Islam and Muslims. With no end in sight of the war on terror; and questions about the compatibility of Islam with Western societies, the need for honest and accurate information about Muslims has never been greater. In the case of Muslim women especially, ignorance and sensationalism abound. What could be more welcome than an examination of the life of a Muslim woman who is neither a silent victim of oppression, waiting to be saved by a secular revolution, nor an apologist for misguided ideology, but an intelligent woman of faith and integrity? Laleh Bakhtiar has lived a remarkable life - but a life with which we can relate, because while some of her experiences appear exotic to the typical American, her values and principles are not. A biography of Laleh Bakhtiar is sure to shed much needed light on humanity.MARCIA HERMANSEN DIRECTOR OF ISLAMIC WORLD STUDIES PROGRAM AND PROFESSOR IN THE THEOLOGY DEPARTMENT LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO. One of things that strikes me about the translation is how its reception in the mainstream; Muslim community--at least in North America, made it less acceptable or even unacceptable for Muslim community leaders to simply repeat misogynistic interpretations. I refer specifically to the ISNA representative in Canada who wanted to ban the book--and the response from US leadership that ISNA supports women's rights and allows expression of a variety of opinions on Islam. It is clear that this pioneering project opened up conversations about gender relations in the community that needed to take place, and provoked a productive re-examination of assumptions about interpretation and authority. --Sublime Quran website; Wikipedia: Laleh Bakhtiar<br><br>YORIYOS SON OF YUSUF ISLAM (FORMERLY CAT STEVENS) We love and appreciate the work your mother has done and continues to do, Alhamdullilah. MashAllah, Thank you for your work Laleh. My father (Yusuf Islam) and I have been reading your books in admiration. We champion you and pray you are eternally blessed. With Peace and Much Respect Yoriyos --Sublime Quran website; Wikipedia: Laleh Bakhtiar<br><br>DAVE EGGERS AMERICAN NOVELITY AUTHOR OF ZEITOUN on the Oprah show recommends the Sublime Quran. I'm giving copies of the Qur'an, in a new translation by Laleh Bakhtiar. For anyone who wants to know more about Islam, or simply wants to read a beautiful book, this really is the most accessible version in English. ASMA BARLAS, PHD ITHACA COLLEGE DIRECTOR CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF CULTURE, RACE AND ETHNICITY. As to my thoughts on the Sublime Qur'an, since I am not a scholar of Arabic, I can't talk about its linguistic accuracy, etc. However, what I think is significant about Laleh Bakhtiar's translation is that it opens up new interpretive possibilities for Muslims. As I always point out, the Quran says that those who read it for its best meanings are the ones whom God has guided (39:18). This suggests that we can-- and should --have more than one reading/ interpretation/ translation so that we can find the best among these. Of course, notions of best are likely to differ over time but that is to be expected. Besides, what makes the Quran a universal text, by which I mean a text that is always integral to our lives, no matter the age in which we live, is that each generation can continue to find new meanings in it. In contributing to that endeavor, Dr. Bakhtiar has opened new doors for Muslims; whether someone wants to walk through these or not is, naturally, up to them. --Sublime Quran website; Wikipedia: Laleh Bakhtiar</p><h2>Martinis &amp; Mayhem: A Murder, She Wrote Mystery</h2><p><b>Jessica Fletcher solves a murder by the bay in this mystery in the USA Today bestselling Murder, She Wrote series...</b><br><br>Cabot Cove, Maine's most famous mystery author is excited about promoting her new book in glamorous San Francisco.

He is winner of both the Royal Society Michael Faraday medal and the Institute of Physics Kelvin medal for his science communication work. <i>Paradox </i>is his fifth book.This exploration of enigmas in physics is aimed at popular-science readers, but in places, it does require at least a working knowledge of higher math. Some of the famous paradoxes (or, rather, perceived paradoxes) that quantum physicist and university professor Al-Khalili dissects are relatively easy to grasp, such as the one that explains, despite what our brains might tell us, why you only need a group of 57 people to guarantee that at least two of them will share a birthday. But others, such as Zeno&#x2019;s famous paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise (which seems to suggest that, no matter how fast Achilles runs, he can never catch up to the slower tortoise), take quite a bit of explaining and occasionally some physics history or mathematics. It&#x2019;s a very interesting book with some nifty surprises: Olber&#x2019;s Paradox, for example, which asks why the sky gets dark at night when there are billions of stars up there, provides proof of the Big Bang theory. Not for your average brain-teaser fan, but this volume should have definite appeal to readers with the necessary grounding in the subject. --David Pitt</p><h2>Murder, She Wrote: a Question of Murder</h2><p>Jessica Fletcher is in the Berkshires attending a writers&#x2019; conference at a historic mansion where her friends the Savoys are hosting a murder-mystery party.

The large yellow sunflowers on the mid-calf-length white dress she wore perfectly matched her blond hair and seemingly sunny disposition. Her smile was wide and genuine; there was a sweetness about her that was palpable.</p><p>The young man, named Paul, standing next to her was not so sanguine. He was of medium height and wore a brooding expression along with his khaki slacks, two-tone boat shoes, and pale blue button-down shirt. A maroon cardigan tied loosely around his neck and draped down his back completed his preppy wardrobe. He was handsome in a rough sort of way. By that I mean there was a thickness to his facial features that contributed to what seemed like a perpetual frown. He lacked interest in the others in the drawing room&#x2014;with the single exception, of course, of the young woman, whose name was Cynthia.</p><p>With the young couple were an older man wearing a purple silk smoking jacket, and a patrician woman in knee-high riding boots, wide-hipped tan jodhpurs, and a white silk blouse.</p><p>&#x201c;Feel like taking a walk?&#x201d; Paul asked Cynthia in a voice that carried to the others. Softly he added, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d; He ducked his head down, gave her a quick kiss on the neck, and stroked her arm, gliding his hand from her shoulder down to her fingers.</p><p>Cynthia shivered and took a step forward. &#x201c;What a grand idea,&#x201d; she said, turning to the older couple. &#x201c;I certainly could use a walk. I hear there&#x2019;s a full moon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t see any moon,&#x201d; declared the older man, whose name was Monroe Whittaker. &#x201c;Not with the fog out there off the lake. Besides, there&#x2019;s still snow on the ground, and more in the forecast.&#x201d; His tone was that of a board chairman used to making statements that no one would dare challenge.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, Daddy,&#x201d; Cynthia said, plucking at the collar of her dress. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so warm in here with the fire going. I really need some fresh air. I&#x2019;m sure Paul does, too. Besides, you always say a walk after dinner is good for your digestion. Isn&#x2019;t that how you put it?&#x201d;</p><p>His ruddy, full face set in stone, her father said nothing. Victoria Whittaker addressed Paul. &#x201c;We have a very busy day tomorrow with the attorneys coming. Cynthia will need a clear head. I want to be sure she gets enough rest. Make sure you don&#x2019;t keep her out late again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Cynthia said, kissing her mother&#x2019;s cheek. They put on outdoor jackets, and she wrapped a red and green tartan scarf around her neck. Smiling at Paul, she grabbed his hand and led him through the French doors into the garden, her voice trailing back into the room. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s look for that moon anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t changed my mind,&#x201d; Monroe Whittaker said the moment they were gone. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s patently obvious,&#x201d; his wife said, checking her hair in the mirror over the fireplace. &#x201c;But the least you can do is be civil to him this weekend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Civil?&#x201d; Monroe snorted. &#x201c;How about if I pack his bag and send him away from here? Would that be civil enough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Monroe,&#x201d; his wife scolded, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not thinking clearly. Cynthia is like all young women her age. She&#x2019;s rebelling against us because it&#x2019;s the thing to do. I share your opinion of Paul. He&#x2019;s obviously not of Cynthia&#x2019;s class. I&#x2019;ll give him credit for trying to dress the part, although anyone can see the poor quality of his clothes.&#x201d; Her small laugh was dismissive. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;d expect him to know the difference. His father is a policeman in New York City. Good Lord, you know how crude policemen can be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A cop? How do you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>Victoria turned to her husband, her hand still on her hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recall exactly. Does it matter? He must have told me. But the point is that the more we challenge the young man, the more we&#x2019;ll push Cynthia into the relationship. Trust me, darling, the best way to see the last of him is to shower him with kindness and expose him to our daughter&#x2019;s lifestyle and breeding. He&#x2019;ll become uncomfortable soon enough and seek his own kind.&#x201d; She turned back to the mirror. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll go up. Are you coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; he growled.</p><p>With that, Victoria left her husband alone in the room.</p><p>Monroe went to the doors and peered outside. &#x201c;Damn fog,&#x201d; he muttered. He walked to his desk and slumped heavily in the chair, eyes narrowed, mouth set in a harsh slash. Suddenly, he slammed his fist on the desktop. He reached into a desk drawer, withdrew a bulky envelope that he shoved into the pocket of his smoking jacket, and stormed out the doors into the garden.</p><p>As he left, a maid carrying a carpet sweeper entered the room through another door. She leaned the sweeper against the wall, pulled a cloth from her apron pocket, and proceeded to dust the furniture, moving from a table to the mantel to the desk. She ran her dustrag across the desk&#x2019;s broad mahogany top, then paused and bit her lip. Her eyes darted from the French doors back toward the door through which she&#x2019;d entered the room. Gingerly, so as not to make a sound, she drew open one drawer after another. Each time, she dipped down and twisted her body to see into the back, and rummaged inside with her free hand.</p><p>Victoria&#x2019;s voice could be heard from another room. &#x201c;Monroe, have you seen my handbag?&#x201d;</p><p>The maid swiftly closed the drawers, ran to the other end of the room, and resumed her dusting. She was only a minute into her chores when the room&#x2019;s stillness was assaulted by the sound of a weapon being discharged somewhere outside, followed by a woman&#x2019;s piercing scream.</p><p>Cynthia burst through the doors. &#x201c;Help!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Someone help me!&#x201d;</p><p>Paul stumbled into the room behind her, his jacket open, his hand pressed against his chest. Cardinal red blood oozed through his fingers and ran down the front of his blue shirt. The maid gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. Then, wailing, she rushed out the door and was replaced by Monroe and Victoria Whittaker coming in from opposite ends of the room. Paul fell to his knees at Cynthia&#x2019;s feet. With a final, agonizing gasp, he pitched forward, his face coming to rest on her shoe.</p><p>&#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d; Cynthia shrieked and collapsed into her father&#x2019;s arms, sobbing.</p><p>Victoria tiptoed toward the prone body and leaned in closer. &#x201c;Is he dead?&#x201d; she asked calmly.</p><p>Her husband scowled down at the body on the floor and looked over at his wife. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;d say he&#x2019;s dead. Very dead.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p></p><p><i><b>In what Agatha Christie book did her Belgian</b></i> <br><i><b>detective, Hercule Poirot, make his first</b></i> <br><i><b>appearance?</b></i></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Lawrence Savoy clapped his hands to gain everyone&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;Okay, folks, that wasn&#x2019;t bad.

Confidential</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>White Jazz</i>.&nbsp;He&nbsp;lives&nbsp;in&nbsp;Colorado.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>In a review of&nbsp;<i>American Tabloid&nbsp;</i>(1995), William T. Vollmann made the extraordinary and correct observation that &#x2018;&#x2018;every sentence advances the plot&#x2019;&#x2019; in James Ellroy&#x2019;s 576-page novel. The two subsequent books of Ellroy&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy&#x2019;&#x2019; are even longer, even more densely sequenced, so I won&#x2019;t make a fool&#x2019;s attempt to describe their narrative action. Nor will I even try to expound upon their themes&#x2014;no matter that they show Ellroy long ago embracing what everyone now calls the Deep State, whose extreme-high and extreme-low hidden forces squeeze history out of the vast citizenry caught in the middle. What I can only hope to suggest is the&nbsp;<i>intimacy</i>&nbsp;of these novels, how they remain wondrously suffused, even in moments of spectacular mayhem, with the inner torments of those inflicting violence on others. These relentlessly plotted books are finally not about events; they&#x2019;re about characters.<br><br>Some are tormented by crude certainties and brutal secrets. The most important of these is Pete Bondurant, Ellroy&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;big Caucasian madman,&#x2019;&#x2019; forty years old in 1960, who began piling up a vertiginous body count in the battle of Saipan (&#x2018;&#x2018;He killed them and killed them and killed them&#x2019;&#x2019;). Those deaths, along with the subsequent murder of his own brother back home, become the first reel of Bondurant&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;<i>standard&nbsp;</i>nightmares.&#x2019;&#x2019; Later, he is at the bone-breaking beck and call of Jimmy Hoffa and Howard Hughes and a rogue CIA officer named John Stanton. Though he rampages freely, Pete has the wild sentimentality of a convict: he is able to strangle Betty McDonald, an inconvenient witness, before becoming helplessly devoted to her cat. For years he has the love of Barb Jahelka&#x2014;dedicated, damaged, implicated&#x2014;but he has to worry he&#x2019;ll lose her over his involvement in Jack Kennedy&#x2019;s death and then Bobby&#x2019;s. It is an absurd triumph of Ellroy&#x2019;s artistry, a testament to his own depths of feeling, that Bondurant remains believable.<br><br>But it is the characters tormented by ambivalence, the ones sickened more by doubt than gore, who compel the reader&#x2019;s own disturbed devotion. In&nbsp;<i>American Tabloid&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Cold Six</i>&nbsp;<i>Thousand&nbsp;</i>(2001), we are ensnared by the existence of Ward Littell, a lifelong weathervane in an unending electrical storm. This orphan &#x2018;&#x2018;raised in Jesuit foster homes,&#x2019;&#x2019; an ex-seminarian and trained lawyer turned disillusioned FBI agent, continually divides into &#x2018;&#x2018;Angry Ward&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x2018;Cautious Ward.&#x2019;&#x2019; He is flooded with guilt, drink, paranoia and masochism; Hoover sees him as &#x2018;&#x2018;the world&#x2019;s most dangerous wimp.&#x2019;&#x2019; Drifting left, he gives his heart to the young rackets-busting Robert Kennedy, even while he&#x2019;s supposed to be undermining him for Hoover. Littell embarks on a Grail quest for the Teamsters&#x2019; secret pension-fund books, a potential offering to RFK, but ends up being pulled into the servitude of the Mafia and of Hoffa himself. Five months of sobriety teaches Littell one essential fact: &#x2018;&#x2018;You&#x2019;re capable of anything.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;&#x2018;Anything&#x2019;&#x2019; runs from maudlin tenderness to multiple murders; even to &#x2018;&#x2018;an ugly wave of love&#x2019;&#x2019; for Hoover. He&#x2019;ll imagine he&#x2019;s protecting Martin Luther King&#x2019;s movement even as he&#x2019;s duped into a white-supremacist plot. After the decade&#x2019;s trinity of King and Kennedy assassinations, he&#x2019;ll be able to cry: &#x2018;&#x2018;Their blood&#x2019;s on me.&#x2019;&#x2019; And he will be left with no alternative to the self-erasure he&#x2019;s been seeking all along. As he exits the trilogy, the reader is left terrified of his own suppressions and contradictions.<br><br>The novels are driven by men whose longings and impulses cannot suppress&nbsp;<i>or&nbsp;</i>resolve themselves. Wayne Tedrow, Jr., lives through the last two volumes in the same kind of polarized pain that Littell endures for the first two. A young officer &#x2018;&#x2018;considered incorruptible by Las Vegas Police standards,&#x2019;&#x2019; Wayne is sent to Dallas by his father, a friend of Hoover&#x2019;s, just prior to the Kennedy assassination. (&#x2018;&#x2018;You never know when you might rub shoulders with history.&#x2019;&#x2019;) He experiences incestuous flirtation, revenge-fucking and finally a tender, intense connection with his stepmother, Janice. Wayne Jr. despises his own race hatred and spends his psychological energy trying to control and atone for it, even as he keeps killing blacks. Sonny Liston, the onetime heavyweight champion and occasional goon-savant of the trilogy, puts it this way: &#x2018;&#x2018;That boy just didn&#x2019;t have no hate for anybody, but shit kept finding him. He kept trying to find niggers to kill and niggers to save, and this woman of his thought it was all the same goddamn thing.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>Wayne Sr. explains his son to Ward Littell, who ought to know: &#x2018;&#x2018;Junior was a hider. Junior was a watcher. Junior lit flames. Junior torched. Junior lived in his head.&#x2019;&#x2019; By the spring of &#x2019;68 he&#x2019;ll be &#x2018;&#x2018;muscling&#x2019;&#x2019; Sirhan Sirhan toward RFK at the Ambassador Hotel, and when he watches the riots that follow the killing of Martin Luther King, he thinks: &#x2018;&#x2018;<i>I Did That</i>.&#x2019;&#x2019; When the Nixon years begin, he abets the Mob&#x2019;s scheme to recreate its old Cuba-style action in the Dominican Republic&#x2014;until he flips again and literally cuts the shackles from the slaves building the casinos.<br><br>The greatest of Ellroy&#x2019;s doomed ambivalents, and the biggest stretch of his imagination, is Marshall E. Bowen&#x2014;&#x2018;&#x2018;Anomaly. Incongruity. Anti-white hate-tract subscriber, potential L.A. cop&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;who doesn&#x2019;t come along until the last volume,&nbsp;<i>Blood&#x2019;s A</i>&nbsp;<i>Rover&nbsp;</i>(2009). This African-American who infiltrates left-wing and black militant groups appears cool and pacific but actually &#x2018;&#x2018;lives for the game.&#x2019;&#x2019; On the downlow sexually and in every other way possible, Bowen keeps a journal about the mental vise he lives inside: &#x2018;&#x2018;As always, I abut that maddening disjuncture: the viable construction of black identity and the dubious construction of revolution, as implemented by criminal scum seeking to cash in on legitimate social grievance and cultural trend.&#x2019;&#x2019; (He can&#x2019;t live authentically even in the diary; it ends up being doctored by those who need to frame him.) Bowen finds romantic escape in his obsession&#x2014;shared by a number of characters, including the white-racist cop Scotty Bennett&#x2014;with the years-old unsolved heist of an armored car full of emeralds. But like Littell and Tedrow he can reach only death, not fulfillment.<br><br>It&#x2019;s the same with Dwight Holly, another rogue FBI agent who figures largely in the last two volumes, a man Hoover calls &#x2018;&#x2018;my obedient Yalie thug.&#x2019;&#x2019; Holly shoulders the guilt of some long-ago drunk-driving murders; heads up the racist Operation Black Rabbit; becomes enthralled with two different women of the far left and is nearly, but not quite, persuaded to take out Hoover. In Ellroy&#x2019;s political-psychological calculus, he too has to die, unresolved and unredeemed.<br><br>Which leaves a transfiguring space for the most unlikely character of them all, the real-life Don Crutchfield, a twenty-three-year-old wheelman for an L.A. private investigator, universally regarded as a &#x2018;&#x2018;dipshit,&#x2019;&#x2019; who stumbles into the last volume of the trilogy. Crutch seems at first to be a throwaway, a goofball version of the author&#x2019;s feckless youth: his r�sum� includes Ellroy&#x2019;s legendary phase of peeping, B&amp;E and panty-sniffing, as well as a mother who&#x2019;s been missing, if not actually dead, since he was ten. Crutch could have remained a harmless bit of authorial self-indulgence, Ellroy&#x2019;s comic riff on his own over-interpreted personal mythology, but the character gradually becomes the most important figure in the whole three-volume epic of violence and longing. It is this dipshit who finally pulls Excalibur from its bloody stone; it is this boy-man who hatches out of his own obsessions to receive anointing.<br><br>Crutch begins as an emulator, an overgrown Robin to dirty Batman-like cop Scotty Bennett and the political mass-killer Jean-Philippe Mesplede. He will decide he wants a piece of the mayhem he overhears and initially fears, and will be swept into anti-Castro scalpings; the Mob&#x2019;s Dominican scheme; the ramifying mystery of the emeralds. But his real fixation remains &#x2018;&#x2018;the knife-scar woman,&#x2019;&#x2019; the peerlessly rendered Joan Rosen Klein, Ellroy&#x2019;s avatar of twentieth-century American radicalism and a compulsive passion for Dwight Holly as well. Crutch&#x2019;s crusade for connection with her turns him into &#x2018;&#x2018;the nexus of great and startling events,&#x2019;&#x2019; a position that truly, in a different way from what we expected, makes him the analog of Ellroy, who has this whole fictional world in his hands. He explains to Joan the motive for everything he&#x2019;s done: &#x2018;&#x2018;So women will love me.&#x2019;&#x2019; For women, read Joan, who contains multitudes.<br><br>Ellroy himself has said that his books &#x2018;&#x2018;are all about one thing and one thing only, a man meets a woman.&#x2019;&#x2019; But in the next breath of the same interview, the author stated: &#x2018;&#x2018;I&#x2019;m a Christian: the books are about redemption.&#x2019;&#x2019; Crutch has that covered, too, more fully than any other character in the trilogy. He is not, even early on, just a peeper. He is learning to see not only through the window but also to see himself in the glass. His action becomes bolder; his vision keener. But one never supplants the other. When he finally makes love to Joan, he watches himself doing it.<br><br>Crutch will devote his whole life to avenging her and destroying Hoover, who has called so many tunes in the trilogy, and whose files are themselves a paper castle of voyeurism. Ellroy may be a man of the right, but his fictional alter ego is the one who completes a leftwards political transformation that the ambivalents only begin and then abort. A conservative might say that Ellroy, like Milton, is of the devil&#x2019;s party without knowing it, but the author rejects any notion of apostasy.&nbsp;<i>Blood&#x2019;s A Rover&nbsp;</i>is what it is because a real-life Joan entered&nbsp;<i>Ellroy&#x2019;s&nbsp;</i>real life. He wrote it for her.<br><br>After Hoover and his files meet their fate, the transcendent Crutch, like Ishmael, becomes the only one left to tell the tale. &#x2018;&#x2018;God gave me a restless temperament and a searcher&#x2019;s discipline.&#x2019;&#x2019; Ellroy, who could so easily have remained a dipshit instead of becoming a front-rank artist, allows Crutchfield something he can&#x2019;t allow Littell or Wayne Jr., or Holly or Bowen. He lets him live.<br><br>*<br><i>SHE LIVES!<br></i><br>Thus, on September 21, 1996, did Ellroy inscribe to me an advance copy of&nbsp;<i>My Dark Places</i>. We were in Toledo, Ohio, at a regional convention of the American Booksellers Association, where I was pushing my novel&nbsp;<i>Dewey Defeats Truman&nbsp;</i>and James was drumming up business for&nbsp;<i>My Dark Places</i>, the story of his unsuccessful but liberating search for the man who had murdered Geneva Hilliker Ellroy in 1958. If the case stayed unsolved, the author&#x2019;s childhood trauma bloomed into a new self-awareness. Ellroy is now conscious that&nbsp;<i>Blood&#x2019;s A Rover</i>, more than ten years in the future, would never have been written without the maternal reckoning he experienced in the mid-1990s.<br><br>James had published &#x2018;&#x2018;My Mother&#x2019;s Killer,&#x2019;&#x2019; the dry run for&nbsp;<i>My Dark Places</i>, in&nbsp;<i>Gentlemen&#x2019;s Quarterly</i>, where I was the books columnist and we developed a friendly acquaintance. In Toledo we ran into each other in the hotel elevator and went off for a drink. No,&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>had a drink; James had coffee. I describe him in my diary on that day as &#x2018;&#x2018;militantly sober&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;&#x2018;for nineteen years,&#x2019;&#x2019; he told me, before diagnosing a number of our publishing colleagues as people ruining themselves with alcohol and cigarettes. &#x2018;&#x2018;His conversation is as jazzy and juju-ridden as ever,&#x2019;&#x2019; I noted. We talked about the Kennedy assassination, he from the Grassy Knoll and I from the lone-nutter&#x2019;s sniper perch. But what I most took away from the encounter was a sense of James&#x2019; discipline, his pride in being a man of letters. He has said that he would like to give younger writers, along with an impulse toward &#x2018;&#x2018;moral fiction and Romanticism,&#x2019;&#x2019; a belief in &#x2018;&#x2018;meticulous and assiduous planning.&#x2019;&#x2019; The mapping out of his novels is a matter of Homeric, painstaking rigor. It&#x2019;s his outlines, hundreds of pages per book, that allow him &#x2018;&#x2018;to live improvisationally within the text.&#x2019;&#x2019; No matter how violent and entropic the action on the page may seem, the novels require his obedience to their own laws and consistencies. Freedom follows form. As an artist, Ellroy is closer to Petrarch than to Kerouac.<br><br>But he is also a breaker of forms. He has, in fact, reversed the polarity of most historical fiction. Instead of inventing previously nonexistent characters to function as narrative conveniences, means of access to the famous real-life figures in whom the reader is truly interested, Ellroy makes&nbsp;<i>his&nbsp;</i>creations the focus of reader attention. In the underworld trilogy, Robert F. Kennedy is of no importance except for how he acts upon the psychology of Ward Littell. Ellroy&#x2019;s Howard Hughes and especially J. Edgar Hoover&#x2014;reptilian, slightly camp, brilliantly bent and ultimately demented&#x2014;provide over-the-top entertainment, but&nbsp;<i>they&nbsp;</i>are the foils, the vehicles to plunge us into the churning inner lives of Ellroy&#x2019;s own newborns, such as Pete Bondurant and Dwight Holly. However brilliantly drawn, the major-but-finally-minor historical figures never provide the viewpoint and never lead us to the truth.&nbsp;<br>The invented characters and the reincarnations share an extended opus that is brought to life from an astonishing arsenal of techniques. Start with Ellroy&#x2019;s parodic skills: they derive from an avid and incomparable ear.&nbsp;<i>Hush-Hush&nbsp;</i>magazine, the scandal sheet beloved by readers of the L.A. Quartet, alliterates its way to new political life in&nbsp;<i>American Tabloid</i>, thanks to Lenny Sands, lounge singer, snitch and now stringer: CANCEROUS CASTRO COMMUNISTICALLY CALCIFIES CUBA WHILE HEROIC HERMANOS HUNGER FOR HOMELAND! FBI wiretap transcripts and memoranda scarcely need the typewriter font they&#x2019;re given in the text; their illusion of authenticity is accomplished by the exactness of their diction. Ellroy is not the first writer to deliver hilarious Mob dialogue (&#x2018;&#x2018;It&#x2019;s Mount Ararat, Jimmy. Mount Vesuvius is in fucking Yellowstone Park&#x2019;&#x2019;), but unlike most practitioners of&nbsp;<i>noir&nbsp;</i>he knows the limits of cleverness. &#x2018;&#x2018;Repartee is one thing,&#x2019;&#x2019; says Joe Kennedy&#x2019;s supposed illegitimate daughter, &#x2018;&#x2018;and the truth is another.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>Slang, in both the narration and dialogue, is always operating on two levels, the literal and the ironic; it may be amusing, but it&#x2019;s to be respected, sifted for meaning. When&nbsp;<i>The Cold</i>&nbsp;<i>Six Thousand&nbsp;</i>takes us to Vietnam, the French-Viet patois&#x2014;all &#x2018;&#x2018;diphthongs and shouts&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;proves a fresh aural bonanza. It&#x2019;ll be the same when&nbsp;<i>Blood&#x2019;s a Rover&nbsp;</i>gets to Haiti: &#x2018;&#x2018;Tinted windows shaded all the&nbsp;<i>pauvre&nbsp;</i>shit outside.&#x2019;&#x2019; If the right language, the right words, don&#x2019;t exist, Ellroy makes them up&#x2014;letting compound adjectives take life from a verb: it&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;smack-your-head hot,&#x2019;&#x2019; and the little Dominican houses have &#x2018;&#x2018;boing-your-eyes paint jobs.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>Every one of those sentences advancing the plot still has to have peripheral vision, a strobe-lit descriptive capacity to capture the world we&#x2019;re marauding through.

The documents in this collection take the reader beyond the traditional story of the English colonies. Readers explore the Spanish, French, Dutch, Russian, German, and even Icelandic colonial efforts throughout North America, including California, New Mexico, Texas, the Great Plains, Louisiana, Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New England. Throughout, the collection provides not only the perspectives of Europeans but also of Native Americans and Africans. By looking beyond traditional sources, students see the power and diversity of Native Americans and learn that European domination of the continent was not inevitable. They see different forms of slavery and ways that slaves dealt with their captivity. By considering multiple perspectives, students learn that colonial history was largely the attempts of various peoples to understand strangers and adapt them to their own will.</p><p><b>Kathleen DuVal</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of <i>The Native Ground: Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent</i>. <b>John DuVal</b> is professor English and literary translation at the University of Arkansas and translator of many award-winning books.<i>Interpreting a Continent</i> unleashes a delightful cacophony of voices from colonial North Americans.

Using dyes of the leaves, roots, and flowers to color your cloth and yarn can be an amazing journey into botanical alchemy. In <i>Eco Colour</i>, artistic dyer and colorist India Flint teaches you how to cull and use this gentle and ecologically sustainable alternative to synthetic dyes.<br><br>India explores the fascinating and infinitely variable world of plant color using a wide variety of techniques and recipes. From whole-dyed cloth and applied color to prints and layered dye techniques, India describes only ecologically sustainable plant-dye methods. She uses renewable resources and shows how to do the least possible harm to the dyer, the end user of the object, and the environment. Recipes include a number of entirely new processes developed by India, as well as guidelines for plant collection, directions for the distillation of nontoxic mordants, and methodologies for applying plant dyes.<br><br><i>Eco Colour</i> inspires both the home dyer and textile professional seeking to extend their skills using India's successful methods.</p><p><b>India Flint</b> is a designer, artist, writer, and sheep farmer. Her work has been greatly influenced by her extensive travels--from Melbourne to rural Austria to Montreal. She is known for the development of the highly distinctive eco-print, an ecologically sustainable plant-based printing process giving brilliant color to cloth. Flint has been working with plant dyes for more than twenty years, and she has artwork in a myriad of collections and museums in Australia, Latvia, and Germany. She currently lives in South Australia.*Starred Review* One of the most elegantly designed crafts books to debut this year, with a sophisticated layout and color photographs that capture well the ecological sensitivities of the artist. Though the art of dyeing has long been associated with natural materials, South Australian first-time author (and creator of hand-made &#x201c;slow&#x201d; fashion) Flint maximizes the use of renewable resources while minimizing most harmful footprints. On occasion, she goes to extremes, justifying, for instance, the use of wood to heat boiling-dye waters. Yet there&#x2019;s much valuable information on every page, in every illustration, throughout each chapter; the author&#x2019;s very careful orientation to the subject, beginning with collecting plants and finishing with special effects and fabric care and feeding, educates and energizes. Notes about history and practical applications (say, the production of indigo and the creation of natural blues through woad plants) are balanced with charts of traditional dye materials and specific details about processing, including plant oddities such as eucalyptus and St. John&#x2019;s wort, different effects froma range of techniques (for instance, hapa-zome, or beating color into cloth, as well as the familiar resist )and mordants (the stuff that fixes or makes color permanent). Urban apartment dwellers might be a bit challenged by the philosophy and processes; and a few materials indigenous to Australia are unavailable to those on other continents. Nonetheless, an excellent source. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>Teacherpreneurs: Innovative Teachers Who Lead But Don&#39;t Leave</h2><p><p>We need a bold new brand of teacher leadership that will create opportunities for teachers to practice, share, and grow their knowledge and expertise.<br> <br> This book is about "teacherpreneurs"&#x2014;highly accomplished classroom teachers who blur the lines of distinction between those who teach in schools and those who lead them.&nbsp;These teacherpreneurs&nbsp;embody the concept that teachers can teach&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;lead the transformation of teaching and learning.

James Vernon&#39;s distinctive history is weaved around an account of the rise, fall and reinvention of liberal ideas of how markets, governments and empires should work. The history takes seriously the different experiences within the British Isles and the British Empire, and offers a global history of Britain. Instead of tracing how Britons made the modern world, Vernon shows how the world shaped the course of Britain&#39;s modern history. Richly illustrated with figures and maps, the book features textboxes (on particular people, places and sources), further reading guides, highlighted key terms and a glossary. A supplementary online package includes additional primary sources, discussion questions, and further reading suggestions, including useful links.

By the time an abridged English edition was published in 1967 as <em>Madness and Civilization</em>, Michel Foucault had shaken the intellectual world. </p> <p>This translation is the first English edition of the complete French texts of the first and second edition, including all prefaces and appendices, some of them unavailable in the existing French edition. </p> <p></p> <p><em>History of Madness</em> begins in the Middle Ages with vivid descriptions of the exclusion and confinement of lepers. Why, Foucault asks, when the leper houses were emptied at the end of the Middle Ages, were they turned into places of confinement for the mad? Why, within the space of several months in 1656, was one out of every hundred people in Paris confined?</p> <p></p> <p>Shifting brilliantly from Descartes and early Enlightenment thought to the founding of the H�pital G�n�ral in Paris and the work of early psychiatrists Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke, Foucault focuses throughout, not only on scientific and medical analyses of madness, but also on the philosophical and cultural values attached to the mad. He also urges us to recognize the creative and liberating forces that madness represents, brilliantly drawing on examples from Goya, Nietzsche, Van Gogh and Artaud.</p> <p></p> <p>The <em>History of Madness</em> is an inspiring and classic work that challenges us to understand madness, reason and power and the forces that shape them. </p></p><p><p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> (1926-84).

There is much porphyry and marble from ancient buildings but every day these marbles are destroyed in a scandalous fashion by being burned to make lime. And what is modern is poor stuff. . . . The men of today, who call themselves Romans, are very different in bearing and conduct from the ancient inhabitants. . . . They all look like cowherds. <p></p><p></p>Other visitors wrote of moss-covered statues, of defaced and indecipherable inscriptions, of "parts within the walls that look like thick woods or caves where forest animals were wont to breed, of deer and hares being caught in the streets . . . of the daily sight of heads and limbs of men who had been executed and quartered being nailed to doors, placed in cages or impaled on spears." <p></p>This was the state of the city that had once been the capital of a mighty empire; now two-thirds of the area inside the walls, which had been built to protect a population of 800,000, was uninhabited, acres of open countryside used for orchards, pasture, and vineyards, and dotted with ancient ruins, which provided safe hiding places for thieves and bandits. And this was the state of the true home of the pope, the leader of the church who could trace his predecessors back in an unbroken line to St. Peter, the apostle entrusted by Christ himself with the care of his flock. <p></p>For most of the fourteenth century, even the papacy had abandoned Rome. In 1305, distressed by the unrest and bloody disturbances in the city, the French Pope Clement V (1305&#x2013;14) had set up his court in Avignon, in the rambling palace on the east bank of the Rh�ne, which is known as the Palais des Papes. In Rome there had been constant calls for the papacy to return from its French exile. Most recently these calls had come from an elderly woman, who could be seen almost every day in the crumbling city, sitting by the door of the convent of San Lorenzo, begging for alms for the poor. <p></p>She was Birgitta Gudmarsson, the daughter of a rich Swedish judge and widow of a Swedish nobleman, to whom she had been married at the age of thirteen and for whom she had borne eight children. Founder of the Brigittines, she had left Sweden after experiencing a vision in which Christ had appeared before her, commanding her to leave immediately for Rome and to remain there until she had witnessed the pope&#x2019;s return. As she went about Rome, from church to crumbling church, house to ruinous house, she claimed to have had further visions; both Jesus and his mother Mary, she said, had spoken to her, and they had strengthened her faith in the restoration of the pope and in the eventual salvation of the city. <p></p>Around the house where she lived stretched the charred shells of burned-out buildings, piles of rotting refuse, deserted palaces, derelict churches, stagnant swamps, fortresses abandoned by their rich owners, who had gone to live on their estates in the Campagna, hovels occupied by families on the verge of starvation. Pilgrims took home with them stories of a gloomy city, whose silence was broken only by the howling of dogs and wolves, and the shouts of rampaging mobs. <p></p>In Avignon the popes remained deaf to the calls for their return, heedless of the prayers that the saintly Birgitta Gudmarsson uttered so fervently and of the letters that the poet Francesco Petrarch wrote, describing the "rubbish heap of history" that Rome had become. This once-superb imperial capital was now a lawless ruin, a city torn by violence in which belligerent factions paraded through the streets with daggers and swords, where houses were invaded and looted by armed bands, pilgrims and travellers were robbed, nuns violated in their convents, and long lines of flagellants filed through the gates, barefoot, their heads covered in cowls, claiming board and lodging but offering no money, scourging their naked bloody backs, chanting frightening hymns outside churches, throwing themselves weeping, moaning, bleeding before the altars. <p></p><p></p><p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Christopher Hibbert and Mary Hollingsworth <p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

It offers practical guidelines for assessing theology and reading theological literature wisely--even when we might disagree with it--and is especially well suited for those reading theology and discussing doctrine for the first time.<br><br>"I have long believed that the Golden Rule applies to how we read theology. To substantiate my belief, I can now point people to Uche Anizor's book. We live in a toxic age of ever-increasing polarization, where charitable discourse is too often the exception rather than the rule. Anizor calls us to read others as charitably as we can before criticizing them as fairly as we can. This is just the tonic we need. <i>How to Read Theology </i>does not simply prescribe but also casts a vision and offers concrete guidance for anyone who wants to become the kind of person who can read theology well. Anizor convincingly argues that the charitable reading is also the most intelligent reading. So take, read, and in reading learn how to read even better."<br>--<b>Kevin&nbsp;J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"This much-needed book guides students to a careful reading of theology that is both charitable and critical in a time when, far too often, readings of theology lack both characteristics. Anizor offers a guide replete with carefully chosen and diverse sources that will help readers understand how to read theology, a task that many times goes undiscussed in introductory courses. This book will be a vital resource for instructors, students, and general readers."<br>--<b>Mary&nbsp;M. Veeneman</b>, North Park University<br><br>"Anizor's wonderfully crafted book explains, as the title says, how to read theology. What's more, it exhibits the balance Anizor commends in his subtitle: it's both critical and charitable. In a culture full of polarized thinking, characteristics such as nuance, fairness, and balance are as valuable as they are rare.

Her innovative exploration of the patterns of thinking, feeling, and behavior which run back through generations is enhanced by her unique adaptation of the genogram (a map utilized in family therapy) highlighting particular planetary placements and aspects that recur in families. Her often dramatic case material, presented in fascinating detail, is rich and revealing, and we are gradually offered a profound vision of the intricately woven tapestry of the family matrix from which we spring, and the ways in which we repeat - or transform - the astrological and psychological inheritance which each of us carries.</p></p><p>Lynn Bell is a consulting astrologer in Paris, France, and teaches at the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London and at the Caroline Myss Education Institute.

In it, he challenged the flabby faith and compromises of German Christians, famously writing, When Christ calls a man he bids him come and die. Now, seventy-three years after the book was first published, Jon Walker writes <i>Costly Grace: A Contemporary View of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's The Cost of Discipleship</i>. <br>Walker brings to a new generation the timeless message of Bonhoeffer against the background of today's political upheaval and societal change and what it means to those who claim to follow Christ's teachings. <br>Christianity Today named Bonhoeffer's book one of the ten most influential books of the twentieth century, but although the book still has a loyal readership, it has not been adequately viewed through the eyes of the twenty-first century, until now. <br>In <i>Costly Grace</i>, Walker, who worked with Rick Warren for several years and recently authored <i>Growing with Purpose</i> (Zondervan, 2009), writes a book that will challenge contemporary teachings and lifestyles. <br>Grace is a foundational doctrine for Christians, yet it is one of the most misunderstood. Bonhoeffer watched as many used the doctrine of grace as an excuse to do whatever they wanted, and in response, he wrote his classic work on what it truly means to follow Jesus. We cheapen grace, he declared, when we use it to compromise our behavior or to lower the standards of God s Word. In a modern retelling of this Christian classic, Walker explains what Bonhoeffer meant when he taught that grace is free but will cost us everything.</p><p>Dietrich Bonheoffer saw the church abandoning Christ in two ways and both are as prevalent today as they were in Bonheoffer's generation.<br><br>First, Bonhoeffer says the church has reduced the gospel to a set of burdensome rules, the antithesis of the easy yoke we should find in Jesus. We've loaded the gospel down with so many extra-biblical routines and regulations--a real Christian ought to, has to, must do--that it is difficult for anyone to find the real Jesus, let alone make a clear and conscious decision to follow Christ.<br><br>We proclaim a religion of rules, which appeals to our prideful desire to show God we're good enough for his kingdom. We make our legal lists and that makes us legalists. Essentially, we're teaching people they have to work their way up to God's standard of righteousness, which challenges the very Word of God, who is the crucified and resurrected Jesus. It is a hopeless proposition and God meant it to be so--he wants us to understand that we can't because only Jesus can.<br><br>When we keep insisting that, through our behaviors and our attitudes, we can match godly standards of righteousness, is it any wonder why the world sees Jesus as insignificant?<br><br>Second, Bonhoeffer says we've wrapped the gospel in a sense of false hopes, using the doctrine of grace as an excuse for shallow discipleship and a pervasive acceptance of sin in the Body of Christ. Grace is meant to justify the sinner; yet, we use it to justify our sins. In other words, we've taken "I am a sinner saved by grace" and turned it into "I can sin because of grace." <br><br>Because of this, we've become satisfied with discipleship as mere Bible study, maybe a weekly prayer breakfast, and for the really committed, a handful of rules to follow that make us feel and look particularly pious.<br><br>In either case--a burdensome religion or a presumptive attitude on grace--we end up practicing a religion far removed from the intimate relationship God wants us to have with Jesus Christ.<br><br>Jesus brings us grace and truth -- On the surface, both these extremes look a bit like following Jesus, but my friend and long-time spiritual mentor Steve Pettit says they both attempt to do the impossible: the first tries to separate grace from truth and the second tries to separate truth from grace--either way, it only creates a monumental mess where, instead of becoming monuments to God's grace, we become monuments to our own foolish pride.<br><br>The apostle John tells us that Jesus is full of grace and truth and, now that we have the life of Christ present in our lives, we are full of grace and truth (John 1:14-16). Jesus holds them together in us just as they are held together in him. Pettit says legalists like to dismiss grace while those unrestrained by grace (licentious) want to disregard truth. <br><br>Since Jesus embodies the unity of God's Word (truth) and God's activity (grace), we're quickly greeted by the spirit of error when we try to process either grace or truth apart from the person of Jesus Christ. On the one hand, when we seek life and freedom by following the rules (laws, principles, truths separate from grace), we easily slip into legalism. How do we know when this has happened?<br><br>Says Pettit, "Grace will be seen as license; it will sound like heresy." On the other hand, when we seek life and freedom in self-determination, in choosing whatever feels or seems good, when we become unrestrained by grace (licentious), Pettit says truth will be seen as "law." Truth sounds like legalism if we are abusing grace.<br><br>We're meant to seek life and freedom only in Jesus Christ. The fullness of both grace and truth are in him. His grace is always truthful; his truth is forever gracious. There is no way to have the fullness of grace and truth apart from him. He didn't come to show us ways of grace and truth or give us definitions of grace and truth. He came to be all the grace and all the truth we will ever need and to freely offer both to us in the gift of himself.<br><br>If I am full of grace, there is no excuse for legalism in my life (Matthew 23:4;<br>11:28-30). If I am full of truth, there is no excuse for unrestraint (licentiousness) either (Matthew 5:17-20; John 8:11).<br><br>As we follow Jesus, we find he consistently moves us toward a choice--and then he commands us to make the choice: Will you believe I am adequate to meet your needs or not? Will you let me be myself in and through you or not?<br><br>We must look to Jesus and no where else for our answers. We must know a Christ who is real and solid, and this knowing doesn't come from conveniently memorizing Bible facts or comfortably studying theological systems. It comes in the willingness to pay the cost of knowing him and sacrificially living out of what we believe to be true of him.<br><br>Jesus wants you to know him. He wants you to live an extraordinary life, full of grace and truth. He calls you to a miraculous life, one that requires edge-of-your-seat faith to follow him, where you find yourself asking in joy, "What's next, Jesus? What are you going to do though me today?"<br><br>You can have that. Jesus calls, you must respond. My prayer is that this book will help you see the simplicity of following Jesus while also helping you understand the cost of such discipleship.Jon Walker is the author of <i>Growing with Purpose</i>.

To St Theodore the Studite, writing in the midst of the iconoclastic controversy of the eighth and ninth centuries, it was clear that iconoclasm is a serious error, which alienates its followers from God as much as any other heresy. That is to say, rejection of Christian veneration of images effectively denies God&#39;s incarnation, which alone makes human salvation possible. If Christ could not be portrayed, then He was not truly man, and humanity was not truly united with God in Him. In our own day, when the material world so often is regarded as mere matter, incapable of being transfigured in Christ, St Theodore&#39;s message remains remarkably pertinent.</p><p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>A New Day Rising (Red River of the North #2)</h2><p>The dream of their own farmstead and a good life in America had brought Roald and Ingeborg Bjorklund across the Atlantic to pioneer the virgin prairie of Dakota Territory.

Coetzee's latest novel,&nbsp;<i>The Schooldays of Jesus</i>, is now available from Viking.&nbsp;<i>Late Essays: 2006-2016</i>&nbsp;will be available January 2018.&nbsp;</b></b><br><br>Since 1982, J. M. Coetzee has been dazzling the literary world. After eight novels that have won, among other awards, two Booker Prizes, and most recently, the Nobel Prize, Coetzee has once again crafted an unusual and deeply affecting tale. Told through an ingenious series of formal addresses, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> is, on the surface, the story of a woman's life as mother, sister, lover, and writer. Yet it is also a profound and haunting meditation on the nature of storytelling.</p><p>For South African writer J.M. Coetzee, winner of two Booker Prizes and the 2003 Nobel Prize for Literature, the world of receiving literary awards and giving speeches must be such a commonplace that he has put the circuit at the center of his book, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i>. As the work opens, in fact, the eponymous Elizabeth, a fictional novelist, is in Williamstown, Pennsylvania, to receive the Stowe Award. For her speech at the Williamstown's Altona College she chooses the tired topic, "What Is Realism?" and quickly loses her audience in her unfocused discussion of Kafka. From there, readers follow her to a cruise ship where she is virtually imprisoned as a celebrity lecturer to the ship's guests. Next, she is off to Appleton College where she delivers the annual Gates Lecture. Later, she will even attend a graduation speech. <p> Coetzee has made this project difficult for himself. Occasional writing--writing that includes graduation speeches, acceptance speeches, or even academic lectures--is a less than auspicious form around which to build a long work of fiction. A powerful central character engaged in a challenging stage of life might sustain such a work. Yet, at the start, Coetzee declares that Elizabeth is "old and tired," and her best book, <i>The House on Eccles Street</i> is long in her past. <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> lacks a progressive plot and offers little development over the course of each new performance at the lectern. Readers are given Elizabeth fully formed with only brief glimpses of her past sexual dalliances and literary efforts. </p><p> In the end, <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> seems undecided about its own direction. When Elizabeth is brought to a final reckoning at the gates of the afterlife, she begins to suspect that she is actually in hell, "or at least purgatory: a purgatory of clich�s." Perhaps Coetzee's <i>Elizabeth Costello</i>, which can be read as an extended critique of clich�d writing, is a portrait of this purgatory. While some readers may find Coetzee's philosophical prose sustenance enough on the journey, some will turn back at the gate. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Elizabeth Costello</b> is a humane, moral, and uncompromising creation. <br> <br>The subject of J.M. Coetzee's latest work of fiction is an Australian writer of international renown -- f�ted, studied and honoured. Famous principally for an early novel that established her reputation and from which, it seems, she will never escape, she has reached the stage, late in life, where her remaining function is to be venerated and applauded. <br> <br>One of a new breed of intellectual nomads, her life has become a series of engagements in sterile conference rooms throughout the world -- a private consciousness obliged to reveal itself to a curious public: the presentation of a major award at an American college where she is required to deliver a lecture; a sojourn as the writer-in-residence on a cruise liner during which she encounters a fellow guest lecturer, an African poet also employed to divert the passengers. Then there is a disquieting appearance at a writers' conference in Amsterdam where she finds the subject of her talk unexpectedly among the audience. She has made her life's work the study of other people, yet now it is she who is the object of scrutiny. But, for her, what matters is the continuing search for a means of articulating her vision and the verdict of future generations. <br> <br>J.M. Coetzee's latest work of fiction offers us a profound and delicate vision of literary celebrity, artistry and the private life of the mind. <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Who Ate All the Cookie Dough?</h2><p><p>Kanga wants to make cookies, but someone has eaten all the cookie dough.Who could it be?

Yet despite a surge of popular interest in these remarkable people, few are fully aware of the richness of their artistic legacy, unique in all of pre-Columbian America. Maya art is a rare combination of linear elegance and naturalism blended with dazzling symbolic complexity. Decorated objects, ranging from painted vases and carved jade and shell ornaments to towering stone monuments and building facades, bear the traces of a symbol system that, while fascinating, can make an understanding of these images elusive to the uninitiated.<br><br> Presented here for the first time is a compendium of one hundred hieroglyphs that are also the building blocks of ancient Maya painting and sculpture. Organized thematically, the symbols touch on many facets of the Maya world, from the natural environment&#x2015;animals, plants, the heavens&#x2015;to the mental landscape of gods, myths, and rituals. Using hundreds of line drawings and photographs, Andrea Stone and Marc Zender show how to identify these signs, understand their meaning, and appreciate the novel ways they appear in art. In addition to providing a basic introduction, the authors also offer many new and exciting interpretations. 535 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Although inspired by Richard H. Wilkinson's admirable <i>Reading Egyptian Art</i> (1992), the contents and format of this book are largely of our own devising, dictated by the nature of the Maya visual code.&nbsp; We wrote it with the goal of illustrating the remarkable interdependence of Maya art and hieroglyphic writing in all time periods, from the Late Preclassic period origins of these visual media (in c. 500 BC) to their dissolution in the early Colonial era (c. AD 1550).&nbsp; <br><br>Whether <i>logograms </i>(word signs) or <i>phonetic syllables</i>, Maya signs all derived from artistic depictions of the natural world, and they continued to develop in tandem with art through more than two thousand years of formal development, interaction, and influence.&nbsp; At any given time period, and in any region of the Maya area (now compassing the modern countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras), the depiction of a jaguar in art served as a template for its appearance in writing, and vice versa.&nbsp; The title of our book -- <i>Reading Maya Art: A Hieroglyphic Guide to Ancient Maya Painting and Sculpture</i> -- accurately captures the co-dependence of these visual media, using 100 common hieroglyphs to canvas Maya art for its real world referents, symbolic significances, and linguistic underpinnings.&nbsp; But the book might equally well have been titled <i>Viewing Maya Writing: An Artistic Guide to Ancient Maya Hieroglyphs</i>, so deep was the connection between the artistic and the linguistic in Maya visual culture.<br><br>Join us for a fascinating exploration of the intertwined nature of Maya art and writing.Andrea Stone is a professor of Art History at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

From a sequence of knocks and rattles translated by the young girls as a "voice from beyond," the Modern Spiritualism movement was born. </p><p> Talking to the Dead follows the fascinating story of the two girls who were catapulted into an odd limelight after communicating with spirits that March night. Within a few years, tens of thousands of Americans were flocking to seances. An international movement followed. Yet thirty years after those first knocks, the sisters shocked the country by denying they had ever contacted spirits. Shortly after, the sisters once again changed their story and reaffirmed their belief in the spirit world. Weisberg traces not only the lives of the Fox sisters and their family (including their mysterious Svengali-like sister Leah) but also the social, religious, economic and political climates that provided the breeding ground for the movement. While this is a thorough, compelling overview of a potent time in US history, it is also an incredible ghost story. </p><p> An entertaining read - a story of spirits and conjurors, skeptics and converts - Talking to the Dead is full of emotion and surprise. Yet it will also provoke questions that were being asked in the 19th century, and are still being asked today - how do we know what we know, and how secure are we in our knowledge? </p></p><p>Is it really possible to talk with the dead? As much as modern America is familiar with mediums--think bestselling authors John Edwards and Sylvia Browne--this question still generates passionate opinions from believers and skeptics alike. So one can only imagine the stir that the Fox sisters created in 1848 when they claimed to hear a ghost rapping on the wall of their Hydesville, New York rental house bedroom. The sisters soon discovered that the ghost would tap answers to specific questions. Within days neighbors and travelers were showing up at the house, wanting to converse with the dead rapper. The Fox sisters--Maggie and Kate--went onto become a national phenomenon, holding s�ances and making their livings as celebrity mediums. They were also the leaders of a new movement called the spiritualists. New York-based filmmaker Barbara Weisberg assembled this fascinating and expertly recounted biography. Beyond trying to prove whether the Fox girls were legitimate, Weisberg wrote a study of how two young girls could shape a new spiritual movement in mid-1800s America. "The more I thought about the Fox sisters, the more it seemed to me not only that Kate and Maggie sparked a movement, but that their lives epitomized the conflicts and urges that helped fuel its blaze. The question of the other world aside, the girls' appeal surely stemmed in part from the ways they embodied&#x2014;and intuited&#x2014;their culture's anxieties and ambitions." Ironically, in not trying to prove whether these two were frauds, Weisberg has created a more satisfying human story within a rich historical context, not unlike the tactics used for the bestseller <i>Seabiscuit</i>. And likewise, this could and should easily translate into a dynamite major motion picture. --<i>Gail Hudson</i><p>Barbara Weisberg has also written about the Fox sisters for <em>American Heritage</em> magazine.

In his new book, Lakoff spells out what cognitive science has discovered about reason, and reveals that human reason is far more interesting than we thought it was. Reason is physical, mostly unconscious, metaphorical, emotion-laden, and tied to empathy-and there are biological explanations behind our moral and political thought processes. His call for a New Enlightenment is a bold and striking challenge to the cherished beliefs not only of philosophers, but of pundits, pollsters, and political leaders. <i>The Political Mind</i> is a passionate, erudite, and groundbreaking book that will appeal to anyone interested in how the mind works and how we function socially and politically.</p><p><b>George Lakoff</b> is the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 1972. He previously taught at Harvard and the University of Michigan. He graduated from MIT in 1962 (in mathematics and literature) and received his PhD in linguistics from Indiana University in 1966. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<i> Don't Think of an Elephant!</i>, among other works, and is America's leading expert on the framing of political ideas.To understand why conservative Republicans are so effective at shifting public opinion, you have to understand how their message resonates with our minds physiologically. It is not a matter of logic or argument, says the author. It&#39;s how the message integrates with the &#34;framing stories&#34; of our mind and culture. Lakoff explores these points at great length. As a result, this book is best listened to in pieces, rather than at length. Treat it more like a series of college lectures than an audiobook. Some points are so complex that listeners are urged to print out pages from the publisher&#39;s Website to follow along.

Capitalism dominates, Todd McGowan argues, because it mimics the structure of our desire while hiding the trauma that the system inflicts upon it. People from all backgrounds enjoy what capitalism provides, but at the same time are told more and better is yet to come. Capitalism traps us through an incomplete satisfaction that compels us after the new, the better, and the more.<br><br>Capitalism's parasitic relationship to our desires gives it the illusion of corresponding to our natural impulses, which is how capitalism's defenders characterize it. By understanding this psychic strategy, McGowan hopes to divest us of our addiction to capitalist enrichment and help us rediscover enjoyment as we actually experienced it. By locating it in the present, McGowan frees us from our attachment to a better future and the belief that capitalism is an essential outgrowth of human nature. From this perspective, our economic, social, and political worlds open up to real political change. Eloquent and enlivened by examples from film, television, consumer culture, and everyday life, <i>Capitalism and Desire</i> brings a new, psychoanalytically grounded approach to political and social theory.</p><p>Todd McGowan is associate professor of film studies at the University of Vermont. He is the author of <i>Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of Psychoanalysis</i> (2013) and <i>The Impossible David Lynch</i> (Columbia, 2007), among other books.<i>Capitalism and Desire</i> turns around the predominant leftist whining about the devastating psychic consequences of global capitalism, about how it undermines elementary structures of psychic stability which enable individuals to lead a meaningful life. The focus of Todd McGowan's effort is, rather, the enigma of the success of capitalist ideology: how was it possible for such a destabilizing life practice to fully capture the libidinal lives of billions, how was it possible that continuous crises and states of exception only strengthened its hold? In short, how is it possible that capitalism again and again imposes itself as the cure for the crisis it brings about? In answering these difficult questions, McGowan has produced a classic. (Slavoj Z iz ek)<br><br>McGowan's argument is positively brilliant&#x2015;almost every page brings a startling insight and every chapter compels an exciting reorientation of thought. Because of its paradigm-shifting originality, <i>Capitalism and Desire</i> places McGowan among the most prominent critical thinkers of his generation and competes admirably even with the very best work of the generation before him. (Mari Ruti, author of <i>The Call of Character: Living a Life Worth Living</i>)<br><br>With <i>Capitalism and Desire</i>, McGowan provides an admirably accessible and intellectually sophisticated analysis of the real connections between capitalism and psychoanalysis. This is a wonderful book demonstrating immense intellectual vitality&#x2015;it is simply impossible to ignore. (Fabio Vighi, author of <i>Critical Theory and the Crisis of Contemporary Capitalism</i>)<br><br>How many syntheses of Marx and Freud have been forged in an attempt to ground a critique of capitalism&#x2015;only in the end to fail? After tallying their individual failures, this smart book goes on to confront their underlying problem: a botched reading of Freud. Relying on Lacan's radical re-excavation of Freud, McGowan offers brand-new ideas about the subject's ensnarement in the "freedoms" of capitalism and the possibilities of resistance to them. (Joan Copjec, author of<i> Read My Desire: Lacan Against the Historicists</i>)<br><br>The immense satisfaction of McGowan's latest and most ambitious book is achieved, appropriately enough, by putting capitalism to the test of a suitably profound (and paradoxical) conception of satisfaction. Astonishingly far-ranging in its references yet written in perfectly limpid prose, Capitalism and Desire sets a new high-water mark in contemporary social and political philosophy. A dazzling work of theory. (Richard Boothby, author of <i>Sex on the Couch: What Freud Still Has To Teach Us About Sex and Gender</i>)<br><br>McGowan's book is a reader-friendly and therapeutic dissection of capitalism's success. His examples are readily comprehensible and he avoids heavy academic language. (<i>Scottish Left Review</i>)<br><br>Although there has been, in some circles, a dismissal of Lacan and psychoanalysis more generally, McGowan&#x2019;s impressive application of the seemingly intractable Lacanian subject to the conditions of late capitalism enables those who might otherwise be <i>dis</i>interested in psychoanalysis to see its unique and important contribution.

We are given a Petrarch in our own vernacular, with echoes of Wyatt, Shakespeare, and many who come after." --Harold Bloom</b></p><p><i>Ineffable sweetness, bold, uncanny sweetness</i><br><i>that came to my eyes from her lovely face; </i><br><i>from that day on I'd willingly have closed them, </i><br><i>never to gaze again at lesser beauties.</i><br>--from Sonnet 116</p><p>Petrarch was born in Tuscany and grew up in the south of France. He lived his life in the service of the church, traveled widely, and during his lifetime was a revered, model man of letters. </p><p>Petrarch's greatest gift to posterity was his Rime in vita e morta di Madonna Laura, the cycle of poems popularly known as his songbook. By turns full of wit, languor, and fawning, endlessly inventive, in a tightly composed yet ornate form they record their speaker's unrequited obsession with the woman named Laura. In the centuries after it was designed, the "Petrarchan sonnet," as it would be known, inspired the greatest love poets of the English language-from the times of Spenser and Shakespeare to our own.</p><p>David Young's fresh, idiomatic version of Petrarch's poetry is the most readable and approachable that we have. In his skillful hands, Petrarch almost sounds like a poet out of our own tradition bringing the wheel of influence full circle.</p></p><p><p>The sonnets of <b>Petrarch</b> (Francesco Petrarca, 1304-74) helped to establish Italian as a literary language. <b>David Young</b> is the author of nine volumes of poetry, most recently of <i>At the White Window.</i></p><p>&#x201c;To read love poetry--to speak of the language of love--is to read Petrarch, who is largely responsible for inventing what W. B. Yeats called 'the old high way of love.' David Young has made the old way new again: his translation is limpid, uncluttered, rhythmically alive, and, above all, readable. Lovers of poetry will discover here the language they have spoken all their lives.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Longenbach</i></p><p>&#x201c;David Young's new version of Petrarch makes this great poet seem closer to us than before, both in language and as a living presence. His marginal comments and introduction help to convey a coherent sense of Petrarch the man, his life and the myth he made of it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>W.S. Merwin</i></p><p>&#x201c;True love--or rather, the truest --is always obsessive and unrequited. No one has better dramatized how it scorches the heart and fires the imagination than Petrarch did, centuries ago. He dipped his pen in tears and wrote the poems that have shaped our sense of love--its extremes of longing and loss--ever since. Now in David Young's elegant new versions, his songs are as soaring and searing as ever. Indeed, not only is this a vibrant translation for our day but, their immense range slowly savored, these poems will sound anew the depths of each reader's own heart.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>J.D.

While research and book-length texts on effective supervision have proliferated, these are typically directed towards supervisors and clinical educators.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since it was first published in 2004, Falender and Shafranske's <i>Clinical Supervision: A Competency-Based Approach</i> has become the standard, go-to resource on supervisory and clinical competence. Now the authors have created an empirically-supported yet practical book for student and interns.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written in an interactive style with "real life" case examples and reflection activities, this book shows students how to establish effective working supervisory relationships and understand and make use of formative and summative evaluations. Empirically-supported yet highly practical, this is an essential text that normalizes the anxieties and conflicts that typically arise during supervision.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Carol A.

He also lectures in the Psychiatry Residency Program at the University of California, Los Angeles and has served as president of APA Division 36: Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, and on the APA Council of Representatives. He currently teaches courses on psychotherapy, supervises first-year students through post-graduates, and advises students in research on clinical supervision.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is coauthor of <i>Clinical Supervision: A Competency-Based Approach</i>, coeditor of <i>Casebook for Clinical Supervision: A Competency-Based Approach</i>, editor of <i>Religion and the Clinical Practice of Psychology</i>, and coauthor of <i>Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy</i>, each published by APA.<br> &nbsp;As two eminent leaders in the field, Falender and Shafranske offer a thoughtfully crafted guide for collaborative supervisory endeavors. They provide new therapists with a sophisticated template for enhancing their clinical competence through the supervisory process. It is also ideal for those teaching and supervising future generations of therapists. --Nadine J. Kaslow, PhD, ABPP, School of Medicine, Emory University<br><br>Falendar and Shafranske s goal in writing this guide is to jump start a trainee s process of being a supervisee. They have clearly succeeded. This resource helps supervisees make the most out of supervision and helps supervisors facilitate the professional development of their supervisees. Supervisees benefit, supervisors benefit, and perhaps most important, the vulnerable public receiving their psychological services benefit. --Emil Rodolfa, PhD, Editor, Training and Education in Professional Psychology; Director, Counseling and Psychological Service, University of California-Davis<br><br>This book sets the traditional notion of supervision on its head. They help the supervisee learn how to make the supervisory experience more than a passive transfer of knowledge. While it is a worthwhile book for the supervisor who already wants to engage in collaborative supervision, for the more traditional supervisor, it could be a perspective-changing book. This book makes a valuable contribution to the development of competence in both the supervisee and supervisor. --Jack B. Schaeffer, PhD, ABPP, Chair, Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards Task Force on Supervision Guidelines for Licensing Boards<br><br>"Quite simply, this book is one of the best of its kind, geared specifically to clinical psychology trainees who want to get the most from their formal supervision. Although the primary audience for the book is practicum students and interns, supervisors themselves should read it to improve their own skills. The book is so good that I recommend it as a standard text for trainees with supervisors within psychology training programs.

By June 1941, Germany&#x2019;s war machine looked unstoppable. The Nazi blitzkrieg had taken Poland, France, and the Netherlands with shocking speed. The Luftwaffe had bombed London, while German U-boats wrought havoc on Allied shipping on the Atlantic. And yet, as Holland shows in <i>The Allies Strike Back</i>, cracks were already appearing in Germany&#x2019;s apparent invincibility. When the Americans entered the war in the west, Hitler was bogged down with a savage war of attrition as he attempted to invade the Soviet Union. The Allies soon stormed to victory in North Africa and escalated the bombing of Germany, fatefully turning the tides of the war and threatening the morale of the Third Reich.<p> <br><br>With a wealth of characters from across the western theater of World War II, Holland tells a captivating story while calling on new research that challenges our assumptions and reframes our understanding of this momentous conflict.</p></p><p><b>James Holland</b> is a historian, writer, and broadcaster. The author of <i>The Rise of Germany, 1939-1941</i>, the first book in The War in the West series, as well as the bestselling <i>Fortress Malta</i>, <i>Battle of Britain</i>, and <i>Dam Busters</i>, he has also written numerous works of historical fiction.

He deftly interweaves the experiences of refugees, of civilians, of the warriors&#x2019; loved ones and of the political elites, while never distracting us with meaningless sentimentality or extraneous personal detail.

The first name is Nordlor and comes from the man who discovered it: Fredrick Nordlor, the great explorer who sailed farther into the Northern Sea than any man before. And the second name&#x2014;the name that has made it famous worldwide&#x2014;is the Village of One Thousand Ships.<br><br>Nordlor sits beside a long fjord that stretches all the way to the Great Northern Sea. When it was first settled, no trees grew nearby, so when Fredrick Nordlor wanted to build the village&#x2019;s first house he did not have many options. He built one with snow, but it melted when the spring thaw came. He wove a house from grass, but it turned brittle and crumbled in the summer. He even built a home from seashells dredged out of the fjord, but when winter came there were so many gaps in the walls that it felt colder inside than out.<br><br>In desperation, Fredrick Nordlor pulled apart his own ship and used the wood to build a house. It worked a lot better than the snow and the grass and the shells he had used before. But there was one peculiarity. Even in summer the house was cold and wet, and every night it rocked back and forth as though the ship still sailed upon the sea instead of standing broken on land.<br><br>Fredrick Nordlor thought this peculiarity was limited to the wood pulled from his own ship, but when another boat washed aground and was used to build the village hall, the same thing happened. It was as though the wood from northern ships possessed a special power that made it hold on to the memories it made while still at sea.<br><br>Fredrick Nordlor liked this trait in the wood&#x2014;&#x201c;It gives it a sense of northern character,&#x201d; he would say&#x2014;and so, even when saplings were planted and grew into tall, thick trees in the mountains around the village, it became tradition for all the buildings in Nordlor to be made from sunken ships.<br><br>Over the years, whenever a whaler sank, or even just a small fishing boat, it was dredged into Nordlor Harbor, pulled apart, and built back up into something new. And that is how the village of Nordlor grew. Houses went up, a dock was built, and taverns lined the shore.<br><br>As Nordlor itself grew, so too did its reputation. Soon, people all over the North and South spoke about the village built from sunken ships.<br><br>&#x201c;Fredrick Nordlor had the idea himself,&#x201d; a man from Islo said. &#x201c;He always was a smart one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard he got the idea from his wife,&#x201d; whispered a woman in Iceblown Harbor. &#x201c;Behind every great man is an even greater woman telling him what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Apparently,&#x201d; swore a boy in Whitlock, &#x201c;the village is made from exactly one thousand sunken ships and not a single one more.&#x201d;<br><br>Nordlor became so famous that a prince in the South spent two thousand golden crowns to have a replica built within the walls of his castle. Little Nordlor, it was called, and he loved it more than anything else, even his only son.<br><br>But for a village where everyone wanted to go, hardly anyone ever went there. The snow was too deep, the air was too cold, and the days were too short and dark.<br><br>It was so rare for people to come to Nordlor that when a new person arrived it always caused a stir. Like the time Lady Summer left the South and took up residence in Whalebone Lane. Or the time Mister Bjorkman fled Mournful Harbor and built a tower out of ship masts in the main square. But the one visitor who caused the greatest stir of all was the fortune teller, Freydis Spits.</p><h2>The Garden of Happy Endings: A Novel</h2><p><b>From Barbara O&#x2019;Neal, beloved author of <i>How to Bake a Perfect Life and The Lost Recipe for Happiness,</i> comes another magical, heartfelt novel&#x2014;perfect for fans of Kristin Hannah and Susan Wiggs.</b><br> &nbsp;<br>After tragedy shatters her small community in Seattle, the Reverend Elsa Montgomery has a crisis of faith.

She parked her car beneath an old mon- key tree and let her dog, Charlie, out of the backseat. A long-�legged black rescue with exuberant energy, he knew to mind his manners in crowds, keeping to her right side as they wandered toward the booths and tents set up on the lawn of the Unity church.<br><br>Just as they rounded the edge of the fair, ducking beneath the low arms of a pine tree, Elsa caught the scent of rotten apples. For a moment, she thought it came from an earthly cause, an apple that had fallen behind the booths or lay in the thick grass, forgotten in the rush to get everything ready.<br><br>There were certainly plenty of apples. Apples in baskets and apples in pies and apples floating in a tub filled with cold water for bobbing. Washington State was one of the premier apple-�growing states in the nation, and local orchards had contributed heavily to the annual church festival.<br><br>It took place on the second weekend of October, when the leaves in the Seattle area hung on the trees like construction paper cutouts in shades of red and orange and yellow, and the worst of the winter gloom had not yet set in. The church, a small and humble building that boasted the stained glass art of a now-�famous former parishioner, sat unassumingly in the midst of an arts-�and-�crafts neighborhood, where the houses&#x2014;�and thus the land the church sat upon&#x2014;�were commandingly expensive even after the real estate debacle.<br><br>The harvest committee rented booths to local farmers and craftspeople. It attracted a cheerful crowd of well-�tended parents, their scrubbed children, and obligatory golden retrievers. The families played games and ate caramel apples and plumped up the church coffers better than any other single thing they did every year.<br><br>Elsa loved the fundraiser. It had been one of the first things she had created upon her arrival here as minister nine years ago. This year, the sun was shining, but the air was sharp enough that she wore a pink wool sweater and a pair of jeans with boots. She&#x2019;d left her hair, crazy as it was, loose and curly on her shoulders, and she walked along the tables that were set up outside. Tents were erected over them, just in case.<br><br>As she moved down the center aisle, again she smelled the sulfurous odor of rotten apples. Insistent, dark. She paused, recognizing the warning.<br><br>Something was coming. Something dark and wicked.<br><br>She turned in a slow circle, looking for clues. Apples of ten varieties spilled out of baskets, along with pumpkins and squashes and piles of freshly baked bread. In the face-�painting booth, Kiki Peterson carefully painted dragons on the face of a little girl wearing a fairy tutu. Next to them was a table set up to serve crepes made by Jordan Mariano, a vegetarian chef who attended the church. The menu offered roasted pumpkin and tomato crepes, apples and sugar, or classic chocolate and cream. Nothing seemed amiss. No one who looked out of place. No&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;Reverend!&#x201d;<br><br>Elsa turned, still half seeking. A tall man dressed in khakis and a gold shirt strode toward her. He was a member of the finance committee.<br><br>&#x201c;How are you, George?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a minute, Rev? I want to talk to you about the shortfall in fundraising last week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk about that at the meeting on Wednesday, shall we?&#x201d; She peered over his shoulder, seeking a possible escape. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s on the agenda&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think the committee is taking it seriously.&#x201d;<br><br>She touched his arm. &#x201c;That may be, but let&#x2019;s enjoy this beautiful day and talk about it on Wednesday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; She headed toward a bent old man sitting in the sunshine. &#x201c;How are you, Eddie?&#x201d;<br><br>He turned his nearly blind eyes toward her, wispy white hair springing out in Einstein fashion around his head. &#x201c;If I was any better, I&#x2019;d already be in heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>She let him take her hand, and squeezed it. &#x201c;Glad to hear it. How are the new digs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, fine. I have me a cat and some television, so what more does a man need, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>He was eighty-�nine, suffering from terminal cancer, asthma, high blood pressure, and crippling arthritis, but he put his love in things beyond himself, and that kept his spirits high. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it. I&#x2019;ll be over to see the new place sometime this week, and we&#x2019;ll say a blessing. How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wonderful.&#x201d;<br><br>A trio of girls in plaid shorts and T-�shirts swirled over. &#x201c;Reverend Elsa, we made you some dragonfly wings!&#x201d; The smallest of the trio held up the tissue-�paper-�and-�coat-�hanger wings, pale purple with green and purple glitter. Their faces, too, had been painted with dragons. She looked over to Kiki and winked.<br><br>The teenager smiled. &#x201c;I can paint your face, too, if you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that would be so pretty!&#x201d; the smallest of the girls said. She took Elsa&#x2019;s hand and pulled her toward Kiki and the face-�painting booth. &#x201c;Please, Reverend Elsa?&#x201d;<br><br>Elsa capitulated, and let them pull her down into the chair, their cool little fingers and hands touching her arms, her shoulders, her neck. Someone pulled her hair away from her face, gently, pressed it to her temple. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hold it so you don&#x2019;t get paint on it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Alice.&#x201d; She gave the tiny redhead a kiss on the wrist.<br><br>Alice wiggled happily. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie slumped onto Kiki&#x2019;s foot. &#x201c;Do you want a dragon or a rose or something else?&#x201d; Kiki asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. What do you girls think it should be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A flower!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A dragon!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A castle!&#x201d;<br><br>Kiki laughed. &#x201c;A castle? How about a unicorn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oooh, yeah!&#x201d; Alice traced a spot on Elsa&#x2019;s cheek, the touch as light as gossamer. &#x201c;Right there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I fix your hair?&#x201d; Davina asked, tilting her head sideways. &#x201c;I have a brush. I&#x2019;ll be careful so Kiki doesn&#x2019;t mess up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t mess up,&#x201d; Kiki said. &#x201c;I can do this in my sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, then,&#x201d; Elsa said. &#x201c;You can fix it.&#x201d;<br><br>Kiki dipped her brush into a pot of iridescent white paint. Her extraordinarily long brown hair, straight and glossy, fell in a silky wash over one thin shoulder and she tossed it back. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ready.&#x201d; Elsa closed her eyes as the liquid touched her cheek. The little ones fluttered their hands through her hair, and one hot plump body leaned into her, probably sleepy. The child suddenly bent over and rested her head in Elsa&#x2019;s lap. Gently, Elsa touched her back. The pink bubble gum smell of girl wafted around her.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be such a good mom,&#x201d; Kiki said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so patient.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not married!&#x201d; Alice said, standing on one foot. &#x201c;You have to be married to have a baby.&#x201d;<br><br>Kiki smiled, a twinkle in her dark blue eyes. &#x201c;Well, then she needs to get married.&#x201d;<br><br>Elsa gave her a rueful grin in return. Kiki&#x2019;s mother, Julia, had been trying to matchmake Elsa for months, one very nice man after another, but so far, there had not been a single second date. Julia said she was too hard on men, that Elsa needed to relax a little, but what was the point in that? Why spend your life with someone who wasn&#x2019;t just right?<br><br>Except . . . she wanted children. She&#x2019;d always wanted them, at least four, maybe six. It was beginning to seem as if that might not happen. She was thirty-�eight, and running out of time. And as much as she loved her work, the congregation, and the children of others, she would really mind if she didn&#x2019;t have a child of her own.<br><br>This, please, she said, a soft prayer sent out above the heads of the sweet-�smelling girls, whose hands touched her, patting her hair, painting her face.<br><br>This.<br><br>It was only as she stood up that she again smelled the reek of disaster, deeper now, worse, like bloated fish. She swayed.<br><br>&#x201c;You okay, Rev?&#x201d; Kiki asked.<br><br>Elsa touched her arm. &#x201c;Fine, thanks. Tell your mother I&#x2019;ll see her tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d; Kiki screwed the lid of the paint back on. Blue stick-�on stars decorated her fingernails. &#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s lining up a new one for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Elsa shook her head and left, putting a hand over her upset stomach. She made her way through the crowd and walked into the church, to duck into the haven of her office. She closed the door, as if to leave the threat behind.<br><br>It was a small room, with a single window overlooking the grass and trees and a square of earth planted with chrysanthemums. The d�cor reflected her simple tastes, with airy white curtains that blew on summer breezes, and only a trio of simple photos on the walls, all in a line, memories from her travels. Glastonbury Tor, pointing into a dark heavy sky from the top of an English hill; a shot of a mile marker on the Camino de Santiago, with an abandoned boot on top of it; and a shot of an old man painting a canvas by the sea.<br><br>Below the photos stood a small altar table with a pillar candle and a vase she filled with fresh flowers. Today, they were striped pink and white carnations, and their peppermint aroma lent a sweetness to the air. Elsa lit a candle, asking for protection, for goodness to blow this miasma away. She asked for insight to assist those who might need her, and patience, and stillness.<br><br>When that was finished, she picked up the phone and dialed Joaquin, her oldest friend, who had once been her fianc�. He answered on the second ring. &#x201c;Father Jack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Walking, it&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; Elsa said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting one of my warnings. Will you say some prayers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, I have to get back to the harvest festival. I&#x2019;ll call you later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the fundraiser for the soup kitchen tonight. I won&#x2019;t be back until about ten.&#x201d; He said something over his shoulder, and Elsa imagined him talking to his secretary. &#x201c;Your sister contributed a quilt. It&#x2019;s amazing. She really needs to show them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which one is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a garden, which makes it sound ordinary, only it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shoot a cellphone picture and send it to me.&#x201d; Someone tapped on her door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotta go. Talk soon.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>A thousand miles away, Elsa&#x2019;s sister, Tamsin, knelt in a flower bed, using a hefty pair of garden shears to prune the frost-�killed plants. In the high desert of Pueblo, Colorado, the sun could be very hot even so late in the season, but a giant old elm protected the backyard at high midday. Even so, Tamsin wore a sun hat and long sleeves and gloves to protect her pale white skin.<br><br>Any day she could spend in a garden was a good day in Tamsin&#x2019;s book. She had restored every inch of the 110-�year-�old garden beds herself, reviving ancient peonies and climbing roses; Naked Lady lilies and a bed of poppies that bloomed like lush courtesans each June. Just now, there were only seedpods and withered flowers, so she gave the plants their haircuts, leaving coral bells and intriguing stalks to stand for winter interest. She pruned the roses mercilessly, trimmed the irises to fans of three inches, yanked up annuals and tossed them into the compost heap. It was hard work, sweaty and dirty, but that was what it took to make beauty.<br><br>Her husband, Scott, called to her from an upstairs win- dow. &#x201c;Tamsin, do you know where my black dress shirt is? I can&#x2019;t find it.&#x201d;<br><br>Tamsin rocked back on her heels, and pushed her hat off her hair so that she could see him. Her husband was a big man, tall and broad, and lately a little stout, though she didn&#x2019;t mind. He worked hard as an investment banker, a career that had given Tamsin more luxury than she&#x2019;d ever dreamed of. He played hard, too, with an epicurean lustiness that made her worry sometimes that he&#x2019;d give himself a heart attack.<br><br>He was packing for yet another business trip, this one to Memphis. They were more and more frequent lately. Some, she suspected, were mainly gambling trips, high stakes poker games in back rooms in big cities. He loved gambling, and the black shirt was his favorite for poker.<br><br>None of her business. As long as he kept his head, what did it matter to her? &#x201c;Check the dry cleaning in the downstairs closet.&#x201d; She straightened, slapped dust off her jeans, and her mind drifted back to the garden. Maybe she should divide the peach irises next year. They were looking a little crowded.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Tamsin,&#x201d; Scott called again, and she looked up.<br><br>He leaned from the window and tossed her a small, colorful cloth bag, the kind you could buy at shops that sold Tibetan goods. It landed at her knee with a plop of dust. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little something, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>Smiling, she thought he must have made a good deal. Through the years both she and her daughter, Alexa, had become accustomed to surprises like this. The strings of the bag were tied, and she loosened them, pouring the contents into her hand. A pair of diamond solitaire earrings winked at her. Each was the size of a fingernail, and they glittered even in the shade, sending out rays of yellow and blue and violet.<br><br>Holding them cupped in her palm, she looked up. He was fond of surprise presents, but not this big. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the occasion?&#x201d; she asked in some bewilderment.<br><br>For a minute, he looked too sober, then his usual twinkle returned. &#x201c;Maybe I just want to get lucky before I have to leave.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed, because it was acknowledged between them that Tamsin was by far the more sexual of the two. And lately, he&#x2019;d been very stressed and busy with work. &#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d;<br><br>His hands hung loosely over the windowsill on the third floor of the red sandstone Victorian, one of the most beautiful in the city. Her pride and joy, this house, this garden, the tower room where she created her quilts. &#x201c;Come upstairs, Tamsin,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there.&#x201d; She headed inside, tucked the earrings into the secret drawer in her bread box, and dashed into the downstairs shower. Clean, still damp, she wandered through the house naked and feeling deliciously wicked about it. There were benefits to an empty nest.<br><br>He waited on their enormous bed, tucked demurely beneath the sheets. His bearish chest showed some gray hair lately, and he had started shaving his head because he was balding. He was fifteen years older than she, but she still found him attractive. Loved his size, his twinkling blue eyes, his wicked sense of humor.<br><br>Tamsin took her time walking toward him, knowing her body was still in great shape, that he was immensely proud of her, and that this would be good, hot sex.<br><br>&#x201c;God,&#x201d; he said, holding out a big hand toward her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the luckiest man in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are,&#x201d; she agreed with a chuckle, and dived in beside him.<br><br>Across the world, Tamsin&#x2019;s twenty-�two-�year-�old daughter, Alexa, wore a blue dress and stood on a rooftop garden in Madrid, sipping a glass of Rioja. Around her, sibilant Spanish rose and fell, a perfume for the ear, the most musical of all the languages. There was nowhere in the world she would rather be than in Spain. She inhaled the air of it, dry and light.<br><br>Spain.<br><br>Again.<br><br>At last.<br><br>She had first fallen in love with Spain through her aunt Elsa&#x2019;s stories. Elsa and her boyfriend had walked the Camino de Santiago when they were young, and they had met bandits and ghosts and angels, and travelers from all over the world. Elsa spoke of cows wandering up a street in front of an old woman with a stick in her hand. She told stories of black dogs that seemed to appear out of nowhere, and cidra, a hard cider that was cold and refreshing after a long day of walking. Elsa had seen the enormous censor swinging from the rafters in the cathedral at Santiag...</p><h2>Young&#39;s Analytical Concordance to the Bible (MCD)</h2><p><p>A standard Biblical concordance, Young's casts all words in the Bible into alphabetical order and arranges them under their respective original words.

In this substantial volume, Cardin gathers the totality of his short fiction, including the complete fiction contents of <em>Divinations of the Deep</em> (2002) and <em>Dark Awakenings</em> (2010). Several of the tales have been substantially revised from their original appearances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, Thomas Ligotti, and other masters of cosmic horror, Cardin&#x2019;s fiction explores the convergence of religion, horror, and art in a cosmos that may be actively hostile to our species. In tales long and short (including a new novella co-written with Mark McLaughlin), Cardin rings a succession of changes on those fateful words from the Book of Job: &#x201c;Let those sorcerers who place a curse on days curse that day, those who are skilled to rouse Leviathan.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from his short story collections, Matt Cardin is the editor of <em>Born to Fear: Interviews with Thomas Ligotti</em> (2014) and <em>Horror Literature through History</em> (2017). He is also co-editor of the journal <em>Vastarien.</em></p></p><p><p><em>"To Rouse Leviathan&nbsp;</em>is one of those rare books that produces in a reader the most important reaction one can have to a work of, let us say, the literature of abomination. This reaction takes the form of question: 'From where could this marvel have come?'"&#x2014;<strong>Thomas Ligotti</strong></p><p>"In 1996, a remarkable omnibus was published by Caroll &amp; Graf:&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare Factory</em>, by horror author Thomas Ligotti. It contained three volumes of Ligotti&#x2019;s work to date plus an additional volume featuring revelatory, new stories that had never been collected. The book, long out of print, remains a gem of horror fiction that few others can rival. Now, in the late Summer of 2019, at least one omnibus is worthy to sit on the shelf next to Ligotti&#x2019;s tome:&nbsp;<em>To Rouse Leviathan</em>, by another remarkable, singular author, Matt Cardin. As with&nbsp;<em>The Nightmare Factory,</em>Cardin&#x2019;s book presents material both old and new, all of which impresses with the author&#x2019;s world-class intellect, creativity, and prose craftsmanship. And this is no mere sampling of Cardin&#x2019;s formidable skills and talent. This is a multi-course feast, a table brimming over with sumptuous, dark masterpieces of theologically infused cosmic horror, psychological terror, and bizarre, intimate character studies and confessions. As with Ligotti&#x2019;s legendary omnibus,&nbsp;<em>To Rouse Leviathan&nbsp;</em>is a book to experience, to study, to marvel at, and&#x2014;in those exquisite, uneasy moments in which we keenly feel we are part of Cardin&#x2019;s terrifying fictional world&#x2014;to live in."&#x2014;<strong>Jon Padgett, </strong>author of <em>The Secret of Ventriloquism </em></p><p>"In Matt Cardin's fiction, characters struggle to understand a supernatural that may be opaque to itself.&nbsp; In detailing their efforts, Cardin draws on language and imagery from religious texts, re-purposing and recharging familiar tropes and references.&nbsp; The result is an experience of the darkly numinous. Put these stories on the shelf next to Ligotti, Gavin, and Cisco."&#x2014;<strong>John Langan</strong>, author of <em>Sefira and Other Betrayals</em></p><p>"Matt Cardin is one of the most vital figures in 21st-century horror. Whether penning visionary tales of metaphysical terrors or dissecting the genre to find the underlying philosophical pulse that gives the monster life, his work never fails to astonish me. TO ROUSE LEVIATHAN is a landmark volume, one that I can turn to again and again with increasing appreciation."&#x2014;<strong>Richard Gavin</strong>, author of <em>Sylvan Dread</em>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sometimes a collection grabs me from the first story.

She wrote over 50 books, including Regency romances, mysteries, and historical fiction. She was known as the Queen of Regency romance, and was legendary for her research, historical accuracy, and her extraordinary plots and characterizations.</p><p><b>One</b></p> <p>Mrs Wetherby was delighted to receive a morning call from her only surviving brother, but for the first half hour of his visit she was granted no opportunity to do more than exchange a few commonplaces with him over the heads of her vociferous offspring.</p> <p>Sir Gareth Ludlow had arrived in Mount Street just as the schoolroom party, comprising Miss Anna, a lively damsel within a year of her d�b�t, Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, were returning from a promenade in the park under the aegis of their governess. No sooner did these delicately nurtured children catch sight of their uncle's tall, elegant figure than they threw to the winds every precept of gentility, so carefully instilled into their heads by Miss Felbridge, and, with piercing shrieks of: &#x2018;Uncle Gary, Uncle Gary!' raced helter-skelter down the street, to engulf Sir Gareth on their doorstep. By the time Miss Felbridge, clucking but indulgent, had overtaken them, the butler was holding open the door, and Sir Gareth was being borne into the house by his enthusiastic young relatives. He was being pelted with questions and confidences, his eldest niece hanging affectionately on one arm, and his youngest nephew trying to claim his attention by tugging violently at the other, but he disengaged himself for long enough to offer his hand to Miss Felbridge, saying with the smile which never failed to set her heart fluttering in her chaste bosom: &#x2018;How do you do? Don't scold them! It is quite my fault though why I should have this shocking effect upon them I can't conceive! Are you quite well again? You were suffering all the discomfort of a bad attack of rheumatism when last we met.'</p> <p>Miss Felbridge blushed, thanked, and disclaimed, thinking that it was just like dear Sir Gareth to remember such an unimportant thing as the governess's rheumatism. Any further interchange was cut short by the arrival on the scene of Mr Leigh Wetherby, who erupted from the library at the back of the house, exclaiming: &#x2018;Is that Uncle Gary? Oh, by Jove, sir, I'm devilish glad to see you! There's something I particularly wish to ask you!'</p> <p>The whole party then swept Sir Gareth upstairs to the drawing-room, all talking at the tops of their voices, and thus deaf to a halfhearted attempt on Miss Felbridge's part to restrain her charges from bursting in upon their mama in this very irregular fashion.</p> <p>It would have been useless to have persisted, of course. The young Wetherbys, from Leigh, undergoing the rigours of coaching to enable him to embark upon a University career later in the year, to Philip, wrestling with pothooks and hangers, were unanimous in giving it as their considered opinion that nowhere was there to be found a more admirable uncle than Sir Gareth. An attempt to whisk the younger members off to the schoolroom could only have resulted in failure, or, at the best, in a fit of prolonged sulks.</p> <p>In the well-chosen words of Mr Leigh Wetherby, Sir Gareth was the most bang-up fellow that ever drew breath. A noted Corinthian, he was never too high in the instep to show a nephew aspiring to dandyism how to arrange his neckcloth. Master Jack Wetherby, unconcerned with such fopperies as this, spoke warmly of his openhandedness and entire comprehension of the more urgent needs of young gentlemen enduring the privations of life at Eton College. Miss Anna, by no means out yet, knew no greater source of joy and pride than to be taken up to sit beside him in his curricle for a turn or two round the Park, the envy (she was convinced) of every other, less favoured, damsel. As for Miss Elizabeth, and Master Philip, they regarded him as a fount of such dizzy delights as visits to Astley's Amphitheatre, or a Grand Display of Fireworks, and could perceive no fault in him.</p> <p>They were not singular: very few people found fault with Gareth Ludlow. Watching him, as he contrived, while displaying over and over again for the edification of little Philip the magical properties of his repeating watch, to lend an ear to the particular problem exercising Leigh's mind, Mrs Wetherby thought that you would be hard put to it to find a more attractive man, and wished, as she had done a thousand times before, that she could discover some bride for him lovely enough to drive out of his heart the memory of his dead love. Heaven knew that she had spared no pains during the seven years that had elapsed since Clarissa's death to accomplish this end. She had introduced to his notice any number of eligible females, several of them as witty as they were beautiful, but she had never been able to detect in his gray eyes so much as a flicker of the look that had warmed them when they had rested on Clarissa Lincombe.</p> <p>These reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Mr Wetherby, a dependable-looking man in the early forties, who grasped his brother-in-law's hand, saying briefly: &#x2018;Ha, Gary! Glad to see you!' and lost no time in despatching his offspring about their several businesses. This done, he told his wife that she shouldn't encourage the brats to plague their uncle.</p> <p>Sir Gareth, having regained possession of his watch and his quizzing-glass, slipped the one into his pocket, and hung the other round his neck by its long black riband, and said: &#x2018;They don't plague me. I think I had better take Leigh along with me to Crawley Heath next month. A good mill will give him something other to think of than the set of his coats. No, I know you don't approve of prize-fighting, Trixie, but you'll have the boy trying to join the dandy-set if you don't take care!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Nonsense! You don't wish to burden yourself with a scrubby schoolboy!' said Warren, imperfectly concealing his gratification at the invitation.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I do: I like Leigh. You needn't fear I shall let him get into mischief: I won't.'</p> <p>Mrs Wetherby broke in on this, giving utterance to the thought in her mind. &#x2018;Oh, my dear Gary, if you knew how much I long to see you with a son of your own to indulge!'</p> <p>He smiled at her. &#x2018;Do you, Trixie? Well, as it chances, it is that subject which has brought me to see you today.' He saw the look of startled consternation in her face, and burst out laughing. &#x2018;No, no, I am not about to disclose to you the existence of a lusty love-child! Merely that I believe or rather, that I hope I may shortly be demanding your felicitations.'</p> <p>She was for a moment incredulous, and then cried eagerly: &#x2018;Oh, Gary, is it Alice Stockwell?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Alice Stockwell?' he repeated, surprised. &#x2018;The pretty child you have been throwing in my way? My dear! No!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Told you so,' remarked Mr Wetherby, with quiet satisfaction.</p> <p>She could not help feeling a little disappointed, for Miss Stockwell had seemed to be of all her prot�g�es the most eligible. She concealed this very creditably, however, and said: &#x2018;I declare I have not the least guess, then, who it may be. Unless oh, do, pray, tell me at once, Gary!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Why, yes!' he replied, amused at her eagerness. &#x2018;I have asked Brancaster's leave to address myself to Lady Hester.'</p> <p>The effect of this announcement was somewhat disconcerting. Warren, in the act of taking a pinch of snuff, was surprised into sniffing far too violently, and fell into a fit of sneezing; and his lady, after staring at her brother as though she could not believe her ears, burst into tears, exclaiming: &#x2018;Oh, Gary, no!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Beatrix!' he said, between laughter and annoyance.</p> <p>&#x2018;Gareth, are you hoaxing me? Tell me it's a take-in! Yes, of course it is! You would never offer for Hester Theale!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But, Beatrix !' he expostulated. &#x2018;Why should you hold Lady Hester in such aversion?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Aversion! Oh, no! But a girl girl? She must be nine-and-twenty if she's a day! a woman who has been on the shelf these nine years, and more, and never took, or had countenance, or the least degree of modishness You must be out of your senses! You must know you have only to throw the handkerchief Oh, dear, how could you do such a thing?'</p> <p>At this point, her helpmate thought it time to intervene. Gareth was beginning to look vexed. A charming fellow, Gary, with as sweet a temper as any man alive, but it was not to be expected that he would bear with complaisance his sister's strictures on the lady whom he had chosen to be his bride. Why, from amongst all the females only too ready to receive the addresses of a handsome baronet of birth and fortune, he should have selected Hester Theale, who had retired after several unsuccessful seasons to make way for her more marriageable sisters, was certainly a baffling problem, but not one into which Warren thought it seemly to enquire. He therefore cast an admonitory look at his wife, and said: &#x2018;Lady Hester! I am not particularly acquainted with her, but I believe her to be an unexceptionable young woman. Brancaster accepted your offer, of course.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Accepted it?' said Beatrix, emerging from her handkerchief. &#x2018;Jumped at it, you mean! I imagine he must have swooned from the shock!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I wish you will be quiet!' said Warren, exasperated by this intransigent behaviour. &#x2018;Depend upon it, Gary knows what will suit him better than you can! He is not a schoolboy, but a man of five-and-thirty. No doubt Lady Hester will make him an amiable wife.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No doubt!' retorted Beatrix. &#x2018;Amiable, and a dead bore! No, Warren, I will not hush! When I think of all the pretty and lovely girls who have done their best to attach him, and he tells me that he has offered for an insipid female who has neither fortune nor any extraordinary degree of beauty, besides being stupidly shy and dowdy, I oh, I could go into strong hysterics!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if you do, Trixie, I give you fair warning that I shall empty over you the largest jug of water I can find!' responded her brother with unimpaired cordiality. &#x2018;Now, don't be such a goose, my dear! You are putting poor Warren to the blush.'</p> <p>She sprang up, and grasped the lapels of his exquisitely cut coat of blue superfine, giving him a shake, and looking up into his smiling eyes with the tears still drowning her own. &#x2018;Gary, you do not love her, nor she you! I have never seen the least sign that she regards you even with partiality. Only tell me what she has to offer you!'</p> <p>His hands came up to cover hers, removing them from his lapels, and holding them in a strong clasp. &#x2018;I love you dearly, Trixie, but I can't permit you to crumple this coat, you know. Weston made it for me: one of his triumphs, don't you think?' He hesitated, seeing that she was not to be diverted; and then said, slightly pressing her hands: &#x2018;Don't you understand? I had thought that you would. You have told me so many times that it is my duty to marry and, indeed, I know it is, if the name is not to die with me, which I think would be a pity. If Arthur were alive but since Salamanca I've known that I can't continue all my days in single bliss. So !'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, yes, but why this female, Gary?' she demanded. &#x2018;She has nothing!'</p> <p>&#x2018;On the contrary, she has breeding, and good manners, and, as Warren has said, an amiable disposition. I hope I have as much to offer her, and I wish that I had more. But I have not.'</p> <p>The tears sprang to her eyes again, and spilled over. &#x2018;Oh, my dearest brother, still? It is more than seven years since '</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, more than seven years,' he interrupted. &#x2018;Don't cry, Trixie! I assure you I don't grieve any longer, or even think of Clarissa, except now and then, when something occurs which perhaps brings her to my memory. But I have never fallen in love again. Not with any of the delightful girls you have been so obliging as to cast in my way! I believe I could never feel for another what I once felt for Clarissa, so it seems to me that to be making a bid for the sort of girl you would wish me to marry would be a shabby thing to do. I have a fortune large enough to make me an eligible suitor, and I daresay the Stockwells would give their consent, were I to offer for Miss Alice '</p> <p>&#x2018;Indeed they would! And Alice is disposed to have a tendre for you, which you must have perceived. So, why ?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, for that very reason, perhaps. Such a beautiful and spirited girl is worthy of so much more than I could give her. Lady Hester, on the other hand ' He broke off, the ready laughter springing into his eyes. &#x2018;What a wretch you are, Trix! You are forcing me to say such things as must make me sound like the veriest coxcomb!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What you mean,' said Beatrix ruthlessly, &#x2018;is that Lady Hester is too insipid to like anyone!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't mean anything of the sort. She is shy, but I don't think her insipid. Indeed, I have sometimes suspected that if she were not for ever being snubbed by her father, and her quite odious sisters, she would show that she has a lively sense of the ridiculous. Let us say, merely, that she has not a romantic disposition! And as I must surely be considered to be beyond the age of romance, I believe that with mutual liking to help us we may be tolerably comfortable together. Her situation now is unhappy, which encourages me to hope that she may look favourably upon my proposal.'</p> <p>Mrs Wetherby uttered a scornful exclamation, and even her stolid spouse blinked. That he rated his very obvious attractions low was one of the things one liked in Gary, but this was coming it a trifle too strong. &#x2018;No doubt of that,' Warren said dryly. &#x2018;May as well wish you happy at once, Gary which I'm sure I hope you will be. Not but what However, it is no business of mine! You know best what will suit you.'</p> <p>It was not to be expected that Mrs Wetherby could bring herself to agree with this pronouncement; but she appeared to realize the futility of further argument, and beyond prophesying disaster she said no more until she was alone with her husband. She had then a great deal to say, which he bore with great patience, entering no caveat until she said bitterly: &#x2018;How any man who had been betrothed to Clarissa Lincombe could offer for Hester Theale is something I shall never understand nor anyone else, I daresay!'</p> <p>At this point, Warren's brow wrinkled, and he said in a dubious tone: &#x2018;Well, I don't know.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I should think not, indeed! Only consider how lovely Clarissa was, and how gay, and how spirited, and then picture to yourself Lady Hester!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but that ain't what I meant,' replied Warren. &#x2018;I'm not saying Clarissa wasn't a regular out-and-outer, because the lord knows she was, but, if you ask me, she had too much spirit!'</p> <p>Beatrix stared at him. &#x2018;I never heard you say so before!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Haven't said it before.

Mind, I'm not saying that it wasn't a triumph, because it was. When I think of all the fellows she had dangling after her lord, she could have been a duchess if she'd wanted!

Written just before Donald Trump&#x2019;s Electoral College victory, Nader&#x2019;s latest book reads with even greater urgency now."--<i>Yes Magazine</i></p><p>In <i>Breaking Through Power</i>, <b>Ralph Nader</b> draws from a lifetime waging--and often winning--David vs. Goliath battles against big corporations and the United States government. In this succinct, Tom Paine-style wake-up call, the iconic consumer advocate highlights the success stories of fellow Americans who organize change and work together to derail the many ways in which wealth manipulates politics, labor, media, the environment, and the quality of national life today. Nader makes an inspired case about how the nation can--and must--be democratically managed by communities guided by the United States Constitution, not by the dictates of big businesses and the wealthy few. This is classic Ralph Nader, a crystallization of the core political beliefs and commitments that have driven his lifetime of advocacy for greater democracy.</p><p>"Ralph Nader is the grand progressive of our time. We overlook his words at our own peril! This book is required reading."--<b>Cornel West</b></p><p>"Ralph Nader's <i>Breaking Through Power</i> is a brilliant analysis of corporate power and the popular mechanisms that can be used to wrest back our democracy. No one has been fighting corporate domination longer, or understands it better, than Nader, who will go down in history not only as a prophet but an example of what it means to live the moral life. We disregard his wisdom and his courage at our peril."--<b>Chris Hedges</b>, Pulitzer-Prize winner and author of <i>Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt</i></p><p>"Nader goes beyond delineating the problem and provides a critical prescription to battle the toxicity of unjust power--one that every individual can, and must, embrace."--<b>Nomi Prins</b>, author, <i>All the Presidents' Bankers</i></p><p></p><p>"People are recognizing that our founding, fundamental values of fairness, justice, and opportunity for all--the very values that define our America--are being shoved aside to create an un-America of plutocracy and autocracy. Ralph Nader's new book <i>Breaking Through Power</i> provides progressive boat-rockers with inspiration and a plan for reclaiming America from the greedy Plutocrats and Fat Cats who think democracy is for sale to the highest bidder."--<b>Jim Hightower</b></p><p>"I read Ralph Nader for the same reasons that I read Tom Paine. He knows what he thinks, says what he means, and his courage is a lesson for us all."--<b>Lewis Lapham</b></p><p>"Nader insists on speaking up for the little people and backs his arguments and decent sentiments with hard facts."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>About <b>Ralph Nader:</b> Named by <i>The Atlantic</i> as one of the hundred most influential figures in American history, and by <i>Time</i> and <i>Life</i> magazines as one of the most influential Americans of the twentieth century, Ralph Nader has helped us drive safer cars, eat healthier food, breathe better air, drink cleaner water, and work in safer environments for more than four decades.

Nader is still pressing forward, still cautiously hopeful--even after so many decades in the arena. Things may seem grim but the numbers and the evidence are on our side, he&#x2019;s saying. We know the problems. We know what needs to be done. Here&#x2019;s an action plan. It&#x2019;s time to stop talking and get to work."--Theo Anderson, <i>In These Times</i></p><p>"Nader sustains a strong case of grievances against the 'power of the plutocracy' and 'the present two-party duopoly that ministers to their demands.' In the final chapter, the lengthy 'Why Democracy Works,' the author offers a suggestion for 'Citizens Summons,' which would summon members of Congress home to hear the grievances of their constituents. In an era of political gridlock, Nader argues, mostly convincingly, that a 'left/right alliance' can get the country back on track."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Ralph Nader's small book packs a big wallop and is nothing less than a portable pocket dynamo for energizing citizen action for change. It is a must read for all who want to make a powerful case that an abuse of power is neither deserved nor inevitable, mobilize support for a cause, and chart a course leading to corporate and government responsiveness and accountability. <i>Breaking Through Power</i> reminds us why Mr. Nader has been so influential for over half a century. His soaring optimism and confidence in the ability of people themselves to take back control of their lives demonstrates that the best of Mr. Nader's incomparable legacy is likely yet to come."--Nick Allard, President and Dean, Brooklyn Law School</p><p>". . . books like this inspire and create a common language and framework for us to help divert the historical progression and bend the arc towards justice.

Together they&#39;ve survived the insurmountable, and now they can weather the brutal conditions of Dark After and communicate with the dragons they love. But with this knowledge comes responsibility. What they&#39;ve learned about survival could transform the planet--or, if entrusted to the wrong hands, bring about its destruction. Akki&#39;s insistence that she return to the Rokk to finish her training and begin new experiments drives a chasm between her and Jakkin. Suddenly she finds herself in the midst of a political battle that could claim her life. Only Jakkin can save her.

The whirling blades raised such a dust storm, Jakkin had to squint to see through the windows, and still the world outside seemed filled with sand and grit.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Home . . ." </i>Akki sent Jakkin the single word as they landed, her mind decorating the sending with a picture of the nursery: gray stone surrounded by red sky, which lay beyond the sand and grit. She pushed a strand of dark hair back from her forehead and pressed her face against the window.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Home," </i>Jakkin answered, his sending the blue of the five rivers twisting through tan sands. A cooler reaction, almost as if he were afraid. Only he wasn&#x2019;t afraid, just being cautious. It was an old habit, but a good one.<p></p><b> </b>As Golden&#x2019;s slim hands danced across the console of lights, the blades slowed, then stilled. "Good landing," Golden said. Then he turned and grinned at them. "Even if you two don&#x2019;t know the difference."<p></p><b> </b>Soon the dust settled. A minute more and Jakkin could see through the grit that the landscape was neither as red and gray&#x2014;or as tan and blue&#x2014;as their sendings.<p></p><b> </b>Akki laughed&#x2014;a soft, delightful sound&#x2014;and Jakkin was reminded of other times she &#x2019;d sounded like that. Not many recently; hardly any when they were on the run in the mountains, and none at all in the caves of the trogs. But he remembered them all.<p></p><b> </b>Overhead, Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s five&#x2014;Sssargon, Sssasha, Trisss, Trisssha, and Trissskkette&#x2014;wheeled away, disappearing behind a cluster of trees. In his mind, Jakkin heard them bidding a good-bye, their sendings as bright and fluffy as clouds.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Sssargon goesss. Sssargon fliesss high," </i>sent the largest, and only male. As ever, his sendings were full of himself. And full of what he was doing now. Dragon time was always now. They could remember a trainer, their hatchlings, their nest. They could be taught enough movements to fight warily in a pit. They could recall where a particularly fine patch of wort existed. But otherwise they lived in the now. Still, they&#x2019;d been able to hold on to enough to bring Golden to the rescue, to guide him to where Jakkin and Akki had been on the run from the trogs who slaughtered dragons in their caves.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Thanks, my friends." </i>Jakkin&#x2019;s sending to the dragons was open-ended, brightly colored. Those dragons were the one constant in Jakkin&#x2019;s life besides Akki. He hoped they weren&#x2019;t going far. They linked his past and present, sky and earth, nursery and the wilds. <i>"Good flying, my friends." </i>They were behind the trees, so he couldn&#x2019;t see them any-more. Couldn&#x2019;t hear them, either. But just in case, he called out again with his mind, <i>"Fair wind."<p></p></i><b> </b>A sunny image flittered back to him, actually more like a brain tickle. <i>So at least one of them heard. Probably Sssasha, always the sunny one.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Here we are," Golden said, flicking the last switches on the console. Turning his head, he nodded at Jakkin and Akki, his river-colored eyes glinting at them. "Home. The nursery. Back where your life begins."<p></p><b> </b>It was unclear if he was making a joke or a simple statement. Jakkin had never been able to read Golden easily, and unlike the dragons&#x2019; minds, Golden&#x2019;s was closed. Of course Jakkin knew that humans had closed minds, but it was something he would have to get used to, now that they were back.<p></p><b> </b><i>Back home.<p></p></i><b> </b>Unbuckling his seat belt, Golden stood and stretched. Walking to the copter door, he pushed it open, then flicked a switch that unfolded a set of stairs. Descending the steps backward, he signaled Jakkin and Akki to follow the same way.<p></p><b> </b>As Jakkin climbed down from the copter, he looked over his shoulder. The shock of it all&#x2014;gates, wood-and stone walls, dusty yard, and the blue water in the weir&#x2014; seemed overwhelmingly like a dream. So self-contained, so comfortable, so . . . familiar.<p></p><b> </b>He and Akki had been living for a year as outlaws, exiles. Running, hiding, afraid all the time. Well, maybe not <i>all </i>of the time, but a lot of the time. Living in caves, without real beds. Worrying about where their next meal would come from. How often he &#x2019;d dreamed about coming home to the nursery, but he &#x2019;d never really believed it could ever happen. Too many people with too many grievances were still looking for them. Like the Austar wardens who wanted to put them in jail; the rebels who wanted to kill them outright.<p></p><b> </b>Yet according to Golden, all that was no longer true. At least the rebels were satisfied, the wardens, too. Jakkin set his lips together. Not that he mistrusted Golden, but it seemed too good to be . . .<p></p><b> </b>Now, of course, they had another problem&#x2014;the trogs in the caves probably wanted Jakkin and Akki dead, because they didn&#x2019;t want the secret of their caves to come out. And they probably wanted their two dragons back as well.<p></p><b> </b><i>I regret none of that, </i>Jakkin thought. <i>None.<p></p></i><b> </b>And none of the past year, either. Oh, it had been a hard year. But, though hard, life in the mountains had given both Jakkin and Akki a taste for freedom. He mulled that over. <i>A taste for freedom.<p></p></i><b> </b>He hadn&#x2019;t realized he&#x2019;d sent it till Akki answered him. <i>"And a hunger for home."<p></p></i><b> </b>Jakkin nodded. Many times he&#x2019;d been sure they would die up in the mountains, with only Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s hatchlings to mourn them.<p></p><b> </b><i>"And Sssargon to comment on it all." </i>This time there was a bubbling laugh in Akki&#x2019;s sending.<p></p><b> </b><i>But home? </i>He&#x2019;d never really believed they could return.<p></p><b> </b>Reaching solid ground, Jakkin turned, then stared at the dragon nursery. Without realizing what he was doing, he rubbed the thin bracelet of scar tissue on his wrist. The whole of that year in the mountains, he&#x2019;d tried to keep his deepest longings for the nursery shielded so that Akki couldn&#x2019;t read his heartache and add it to her own. Now that they were actually back, he felt he should be elated. What he actually felt was . . .<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared?" </i>Akki&#x2019;s sending was tentative, wavery, like the water at the bottom of the falls.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Stay out of my mind!" </i>he answered, with black and gold arrow points. Sharper than he meant. To soften it, he turned back and reached a hand up to help her down, for she was facing forward as she came down the steps, carefully cradling the young dragon hatchling. Its back and belly were still patch worked with the last of its gray eggskin, and it looped its tail securely around her wrist.<p></p><b> </b>"Thanks," she whispered to Jakkin, and smiled&#x2014;a tremulous, tentative smile. It said even more than her sending.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared."<p></p></i><b> </b>This time the sending was not Akki&#x2019;s. Anxiously, Jakkin looked around. Finally he spotted the sender&#x2014;Auricle, the pale red adult dragon they&#x2019;d brought out of the caves before she could be sacrificed by the trogs. She was crouched on the far side of the nursery yard, tail twitching. Not one of Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s brood, she was possibly a cousin, for her color and sendings were reminiscent of the red dragon&#x2019;s. He and Akki had gotten her out of the caves just in time. Into the air. Showed her that she could fly, that she could be free.<p></p><b> </b>Auricle&#x2019;s neck arched downward and her neck scales fluttered, which meant that any moment she might bolt. <i>It&#x2019;s astonishing that she&#x2019;s landed here and not actually flown off with the others,</i> Jakkin thought. In <i>her </i>mind, men were not safe. Not even her rescuers. <i>Not Akki. Not me.<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Here?" </i>Jakkin hadn&#x2019;t meant to send the question, blue, stuttering, but Auricle caught a glimpse of it anyway.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Here," </i>she answered in the same color, but even more faded. The membranes on her eyes closed, effectively shuttering them.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin&#x2019;s thoughts followed one another in quick succession: Auricle was probably <i>here </i>because she wasn&#x2019;t used to flying, having been kept in that underground prison the whole of her life except for the one time when she was bred. Or perhaps she was <i>here </i>because Akki had the dragonling. Or because she was exhausted. Or because she was . . .<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared."<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Gentle Auricle." </i>This time Jakkin&#x2019;s blue sending was edged about with soft beige billows. <i>"Do not be afraid. We are with thee. Soon thee will be altogether safe." </i>Dragon masters in the nursery always spoke that way to their charges, "thee" and "thou." Jakkin didn&#x2019;t know why. It was just how things were done. And it certainly calmed them down.<p></p><b> </b>Auricle lifted her head slightly. Her eyes were dark but without the fire of a fighting dragon. Even if she hadn&#x2019;t sent her fear to him, he would have known it by her posture: the crouch, the lashing tail, the shuttered eyes. She was afraid of the copter, of the nursery, of the memory of the trogs. Well, she had a right to be afraid of the trogs. <i>I&#x2019;m afraid of them, too.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Jakkin!" Akki&#x2019;s voice gave a warning.<p></p><b> </b>He thought she meant he was broadcasting his own fear to the terrified Auricle, but Akki was pointing in a different direction. He turned, caught something out of the corner of his eye, and startled, before realizing that the door of the bondhouse had flown open.<p></p><b> </b>Out ran the fat cook, Kkarina, though it was more like a fast waddle. Her haste was understandable. Any copter was a rare sight at the nursery. Usually the appearance of one meant bad news. Wiping her hands nervously on her long apron, Kkarina stared at Golden, who was standing several steps away from the copter&#x2019;s blades. Her hands left dark red stains on the white cloth of her apron, stains that could have been either takk or blood.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin licked his lips, just thinking about a cup of takk, the taste a sudden vivid recollection in his mouth. After a year of drinking boil&#x2014;that thin soup made from greasy skagg grass&#x2014;he was more than ready for takk. A whole pot of it. Two whole pots of it! And then he remembered what it was made of&#x2014;dragon&#x2019;s blood. <i>"It&#x2019;s back to boil," </i>he sent Akki, at the same time including a picture of him bathing in a pot of the gray-green stuff. Akki broke into sudden, nervous laughter.<p></p><b> </b>Hearing Akki&#x2019;s laugh, Kkarina gasped, her face an alarming crimson. She turned and finally registered who Golden&#x2019;s passengers were. Without warning, she burst into tears and threw her apron up over her head.<p></p><b> </b>"Kkarina," Akki said with a sweetness Jakkin hadn&#x2019;t heard from her in a while, "Kay&#x2014;it&#x2019;s me." That set the old woman to crying even harder.<p></p><b> </b>Still sobbing, the cook lowered her apron, waddled up to them, and gathered up Akki and Jakkin in her massive arms, which threatened to break bones and bring bruises. Kkarina smelled of fresh bread and sharp takk, and something burnt.<i><p></p></i><b> </b><i>She smells of home. </i>His knees suddenly buckled. <i>Home.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Oh, oh, oh . . ." Kkarina said over and over. "Oh, oh, oh," without letting go of either of them.<p></p><b> </b>At last Akki cried out, "Kkarina, you&#x2019;re crushing me&#x2014;<i>and </i>the dragonling." It was true. The old cook had enfolded all three of them in her hard embrace.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin was incapable of speech.<p></p><b> </b>"Oh, oh, oh," Kkarina said one more time, then let them go.<p></p><b> </b>Again, out of the corner of his eye, Jakkin saw movement, this time on his right. He stepped in front of Akki, to shield her, before realizing it was only old Balakk, the plowman, coming in from the fields. Next to him was Trikko and someone else, a moonfaced boy with stringy blond hair whom Jakkin didn&#x2019;t recognize.<p></p><b> </b>Balakk had spotted the copter, then Jakkin and Akki, and began complaining even before he was close. They had to strain to hear him. "All those days of mourning," he started. "And me hardly able to work, thinking about you two dead out there in the mountains in the cold. Little Jakkin, little Akki." Though of course neither of them had been little&#x2014;then or now. Indeed, they hadn&#x2019;t been little for quite some time. And of course neither of them had been dead, though how was poor Balakk to have known?<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin stared at Balakk&#x2019;s moonfaced companion, wondering who he was, how he &#x2019;d gotten to the nursery. Of course, a year was a long time to be away. People could die, move to the city, be sent offworld. People could grow old, forgetful, take on new apprentices. People could change.<p></p><b> </b>"We apologize for being both alive and well," Akki said, but with a smile to take away the sting of it.<p></p><b> </b>The dragonling resettled itself, curling up so tightly in Akki&#x2019;s arms, it was almost a dragon ball. At this point, it seemed to regard Akki as its mother.<p></p><b> </b><i>That would be funny, </i>Jakkin thought, <i>if it weren&#x2019;t so . . . so inconvenient. </i>The hatchling had imprinted on Akki early and refused to be parted from her.<p></p><b> </b>Trikko winked at Jakkin as if to say the year away had simply been a ploy to be alone with Akki, but then Trikko&#x2019;s mind always worked that way, from the slightly off-color to the positively filthy. <i>He couldn&#x2019;t, </i>Jakkin thought, <i>understand real love.<p></p></i><b> </b>But looking confused, Balakk turned to Golden, spread his hands, palms to the sky. His new helper touched his arm, as if in comfort. At the same time, a roar from the stud barn made them all turn around. A male dragon, sensing roiling emotion nearby, was simply trying to bring the attention to himself. It was an old dragon trick, and as usual, it worked.<p></p><b> </b>"Typical male," Akki said with an exaggerated eye roll, which broke the tension, and they all laughed&#x2014;even Jakkin.<p></p><b> </b>Only Auricle still seemed perturbed; her sending to Jakkin was laced with red spots that looked a great deal like blood.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Danger?"<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"No danger," </i>he answered soothingly.<p></p><b> </b>"How?" asked Kkarina, meaning how were they still alive?<p></p><b> </b>"When . . . where?" Balakk added, waving a hand.<p></p><b> </b>Trikko&#x2019;s knowing smile spread slowly across his face.<p></p><b> </b>The answers to any of those questions had to be given carefully. Guardedly. Because there <i>was </i>danger, great danger, even if he &#x2019;d just assured Auricle there was none. He and Akki had to be certain that they said the same things, that their versions of the past year&#x2019;s adventures matched exactly. If not, the future of all the dragons on Austar IV could be a bloody one indeed.<p></p><b> </b><i>"If the secret gets out&#x2014;our secret . . ." </i>he thought, adding, <i>"Akki, take care."<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"I&#x2019;m not stupid," </i>she shot back, the red lightning bolt accompanying it lancing through his mind with such force, he almost winced. <i>"But there&#x2019;s no way it can get out unless you tell. Me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m silent as the grave." </i>Facing him directly, so that no one else could see, she lifted her hand to her mouth, then surreptitiously drew her finger across her throat. <i>"See&#x2014;dead, grave, got it?" </i>Afterward, she smiled broadly at Kkarina, at Balakk and his helper, at Golden, even at Trikko.

He graduated from St. Paul&#39;s School in New Hampshire, Brown University, received a master&#39;s degree in fine art from Columbia University and has taught at the State University of New York at Purchase and Bennington College. According to The Writer&#39;s Almanac, Moody dropped out of graduate school at Columbia after a year because he spent most of his time drinking and had a hard time paying his rent or holding a job. Moody stated, &#34;I was a clerk at [a bookstore] and I got fired after one month. They said, &#39;We really like you and we respect you as a writer, but this cash register thing is just not working out.&#39;&#34; Moody finally checked himself into a mental hospital, got sober, and then he wrote his first novel, Garden State, about young people growing up in the industrial wasteland of New Jersey. He lives in Brooklyn and Fishers Island.In 1973, a decaying suburban Connecticut family has a bad day. Father Benjamin Hood is a middle-aged alcoholic, tormented by canker sores, in danger of losing his job as a media and entertainment expert for a high-end brokerage house, and having an affair with a neighbor named Janey. His wife, Elena, is cold and distant, even though she gets a kick reading about impotence in Masters and Johnson and believes herself ``capable of abandon.'' Fourteen-year-old Wendy Hood's raging hormones and desire to break out lead to dry humping in basements and graveyards and a daring public display with a girlfriend at a slumber party. Older brother Paul, relegated to boarding school, gets stoned and compulsively follows the comic book capers of the Fantastic Four. On this fateful day, Janey disappears in the middle of her afternoon rendezvous with Benjamin to do some shopping; Benjamin catches Wendy and Janey's son Mike going at it; Elena confronts Benjamin about his infidelity; Benjamin and Elena find themselves at a neighborhood key party (a '60s tradition that migrated belatedly to suburbia whereby men toss their keys in a bowl at the beginning of the night and at the end of the night the women randomly select a set and go off with its owner); Janey purposely shies away from the Hood key ring; Benjamin passes out on the bathroom floor; Elena goes off with Janey's husband; Wendy wanders over to Mike's house and seduces his younger brother Sandy because Mike isn't around; Paul makes an unsuccessful play for the woman of his dreams with alcohol and drugs; and matters only get worse because a vicious northeaster rages outside. Moody (Garden State, 1992) masterfully captures suburban angst through lucid detail. But his characters lack substance so that we don't care what happens to them, and in the end, it seems, neither do they. Too cold. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This volume comprises the fullest spectrum of his rousing, revolutionary poems, from his first collection to unpublished pieces composed during his final years.<br><br>Throughout Baraka&#x2019;s career as a prolific writer in several genres (also published under the name LeRoi Jones), he was vehemently outspoken against oppression of African American citizens, and he radically altered the discourse surrounding racial inequality. His legacy in world literature is matched by his widespread influence as an activist and cultural leader. Praised for its lyricism and introspection, his early poetry emerged from the Beat generation, while his later writing is marked by the Black Arts Movement's intensely rebellious fervor and subversive ideology. All along, his primary focus was on how to live and love in the present moment despite the enduring difficulties of human history.</p><p><b>Amiri Baraka</b> (1934&#x2013;2014) was an author of poetry, plays, essays, fiction, and music criticism, as well as a groundbreaking political activist who lectured in the United States, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe.

Bodacious and tenacious, he remains a realist rooted sometimes in the political, sometimes in the avant-garde. His voice is made in America; his poetry is an action.

F. K. Fisher&#x2019;s distinguished translation and with a new introduction by Bill Buford.<br><br>First published in France in 1825 and continuously in print ever since, <i>The Physiology of Taste </i>is a historical, philosophical, and ultimately Epicurean collection of recipes, reflections, and anecdotes on everything and anything gastronomical. Brillat-Savarin, who spent his days eating through the famed food capital of Dijon, lent a shrewd, exuberant, and comically witty voice to culinary matters that still resonate today: the rise of the destination restaurant, diet and weight, digestion, and taste and sensibility.</p><p>You can't properly call yourself a gourmand (or even a minor foodie) until you've digested Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's delectable 1825 treatise, <i>The Physiology of Taste: Or, Meditations on Transcendental Gastronomy</i>. Brilliantly and lovingly translated in 1949 by M.F.K. Fisher (herself the doyenne of 20th-century food writing), the book offers the Professor's meditations not just on matters of cooking and eating, but extends to sleep, dreams, exhaustion, and even death (which he defines as the "complete interruption of sensual relations"). Brillat-Savarin, whose genius is in the examination and discussion of food, cooking, and eating, proclaims that "the discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a star."<p> Chocoholics will be satisfied to know that "carefully prepared chocolate is as healthful a food as it is pleasant ... that it is above all helpful to people who must do a great deal of mental work...." He examines the erotic properties of the truffle ("the truffle is not a positive aphrodisiac; but it can, in certain situations, make women tenderer and men more agreeable"), the financial influence of the turkey (apparently quite a prize in 19th-century Paris), and the level of <i>gourmandise</i> among the various professions (bankers, doctors, writers, and men of faith are all predestined to love food). Just as engrossing as the text itself are M.F.K. Fisher's lively, personal glosses at the end of every chapter, which make up almost a quarter of the book. These two are soulmates separated by centuries, and Fisher's fondness for the Professor comes through on every page. As she notes at the end, "I have yet to be bored or offended, which is more than most women can say of any relationship, either ghostly or corporeal." <i>--Rebecca A.

Describing sex as an experience of the soul, Thomas Moore here brings out the fully human side of sex &#x2013; the roles of fantasy, desire, meaning, and morality &#x2013; and draws on religion, mythology art, literature, and film to show how sex is one of the most profound mysteries of life. </p><p> While finding spirituality inherent in sex, Moore also explores how spiritual values can sometimes wound our sexuality. </p><p> Blending rather than opposing spirituality and sexuality, The Soul of Sex offers a fresh, livable way of becoming more deeply sexual and loving in all areas of life.</p></p><p>As in his previous bestsellers <i>Care of the Soul</i> and <i>Soul Mates</i>, Thomas Moore wants us to think more deeply about the spiritual implications of everyday life. Which is to say that this is serious stuff--anyone looking for sexy beach reading won't find it here. What <i>does</i> interest the popular theologian, therapist, and former Catholic monk are the historical, philosophical, religious, and psychological aspects of sexuality that people tend not to consider. "We have a habit of talking about sex as merely physical, and yet nothing has more soul," Moore begins. If only we realized that fact, he then argues, it might relieve us of the guilt we so often feel over our own sex lives. "The problem may be that we are accustomed to imagining morality from a purely spiritual point of view as a way of limiting rather than enhancing sexuality," he continues. Yet if we paid more attention to beauty, sensuality, and pleasure, writes Moore, we might actually <i>enhance</i> our spirituality. <p> There's much more to this wide-ranging meditation, which moves from the history of the word "orgasm" to the mythic presence of Marilyn Monroe. Those willing to follow Moore's mind as it courses through these subjects will find it a fascinating journey, one that ends by stimulating their own thinking about the relationship between sex and the spirit.</p>In this provocative and highly original work, the bestselling author of Care of the Soul and Soul Mates at last restores sex to its rightful place in the human psyche. Describing sex as an experience of the soul, Thomas Moore here brings out the fully human side of sex -- the roles of fantasy, desire, meaning, and morality -- and draws on religion, mythology, art, literature, and film to show how sex contains the most profound mysteries. While finding the spirituality inherent in sex, Moore also explores how spiritual values can sometimes wound our sexuality. He recommends many ways in which society can tone down its moralism and create a public life that is erotic, one that affirms desire and pleasure. He interprets the media&#39;s obsession with sex as a symptom of our failure to weave sex into the whole of life, and spells out an Epicurean lifestyle where the simple pleasures of good food, friends, family, and intimacy with nature give our sexuality a broad and supportive base. Blending rather than opposing spirituality and sexuality, The Soul of Sex offers a fresh, livable way of becoming more deeply sexual and loving in all areas of life.</p><h2>Nelson&#39;s Trafalgar: The Battle That Changed the World</h2><p><b>An explosive chronicle of history's greatest sea battle,&nbsp;<b><b>from the co-author of the forthcoming&nbsp;<i>Gibraltar:&nbsp;The Greatest Siege in British History</i>&nbsp;(March 2018)</b></b><br></b><br> In the tradition of Antony Beevor's <i>Stalingrad, Nelson's Trafalgar</i> presents the definitive blow-by-blow account of the world's most famous naval battle, when the British Royal Navy under Lord Horatio Nelson dealt a decisive blow to the forces of Napoleon.

In 1916 she married Major James Reid Peploe (nephew to the artist Samuel Peploe). After the First World War they lived near Glasgow and brought up two sons and a daughter. Dorothy wrote her first novel in the 1920&#39;s, and by the 1930&#39;s was a prolific bestseller, ultimately selling more than seven million books in her career. Among her many bestselling novels was the series featuring the popular &#34;Mrs. Tim&#34;, the wife of a British Army officer. The author often returned to Scotland and Scottish themes in her romantic, witty and well-observed novels. During the Second World War Dorothy Stevenson moved with her husband to Moffat in Scotland. It was here that most of her subsequent works were written. D.E. Stevenson died in Moffat in 1973.</p><h2>Fantasy Life: The Outrageous, Uplifting, and Heartbreaking World of Fantasy Sports from the Guy Who&#39;s Lived It</h2><p>Includes new chapters with small, easy-to-understand words.

And as the drinks kept flowing, so did the trash talk.</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone in the league was a college athlete, so egos are pretty big,&#x201d; Quin Kilgore remembers. &#x201c;No one could even consider the thought of losing.&#x201d;</p><p>Trash talk leads to bets, and bets lead to rules, and by the end of the evening the group had come to a very simple, but very real, agreement.</p><p>Last place in the league . . . has to get a tattoo.</p><p>Not some lame-ass henna tattoo that fades in a few weeks. No, we&#x2019;re talking a legit, full-on, chosen by the winner, for-the-rest-of-your-life tattoo. Nights that start drunk in a hot tub often end in regret, but &#x201c;sobering up the next morning, we stuck with it,&#x201d; Quin tells me. &#x201c;One of the guys in the league, Spud Mann, was in law school at the time and drew up a contract dictating size, placement, and tone of the tattoo.&#x201d;</p><p>The basic parameters: embarrassing tattoos are allowed, racist ones are not, and no going all Mike Tyson and putting it on the face. &#x201c;Just before the draft that year, we all signed it. And of course, the first year the loser was the guy who drew up the contract . . . Spud Mann.&#x201d;</p><p>Basically, the way the Tattoo League works is, in weeks 15 and 16, the top four play for the right to choose the tattoo and the bottom four are playing to avoid the tattoo. In year two, the loser was a guy named &#x201c;Ron.&#x201d;</p><p>And in year three Adam Palmer got the, uh, honors.</p><p>Now, sometime between two-time league winner Dusty Carter explaining to a tattoo artist exactly what a &#x201c;Tebowing Care Bear&#x201d; should look like and then a year later trying to find the best picture of Justin Bieber to copy, JJ Dunn was in Spokane, Washington, working on one of his 10 fantasy football teams.</p><p>&#x201c;I had stayed up an hour longer than I was planning to adjust my roster, and because of that I was able to hear a very quiet sound coming from my son&#x2019;s room in the basement.&#x201d;</p><p>JJ decided to check out the sound before he went to bed. &#x201c;I found my 13-year-old boy without a pulse. I started CPR and yelled for my wife to wake up and call 911. Paramedics got there quickly, and after a lot of effort, Jake&#x2019;s heart started pumping on its own. Jake has since been declared all but a miracle kid, suffering no brain damage. If it wasn&#x2019;t for fantasy football, I never would have been up at that hour and heard that. It may seem like hyperbole, but fantasy football helped save my son&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;</p><p>Getting the word LOSER permanently inked on your body and being the reason your child is still alive are polar opposite stories, but in the world of fantasy sports I got news for you: neither one surprises me. When you&#x2019;re done with this book, you&#x2019;ll realize the same thing I did:</p><p>From birth to funerals and everything in between, there is no aspect of life that fantasy doesn&#x2019;t touch.</p><p>Most important, it touches people. I&#x2019;ve said this a million times in interviews over the years. Long before Twitter, Facebook, or even MySpace and Friendster, fantasy football was the original online community. And now there are millions of people with the same shared experiences.</p><p>From friends from high school, college, or work, to couples, families, and even people you&#x2019;ve only &#x201c;met&#x201d; online . . . I know of leagues from every walk of life. Heikki Larsen and the &#x201c;Margarillas&#x201d; play while on tour with Jimmy Buffett. Many major league baseball players have a clubhouse fantasy football league with their teammates, including CC Sabathia, who would like you to know he&#x2019;s the 2012 New York Yankees clubhouse champion. There are leagues with prison inmates and leagues done on Army bases overseas. Dr. Melanie Friedlander plays in a league of all orthopedic surgeons. All 10 owners in Don Carlson&#x2019;s league are from Fire Station 1 in the Los Angeles Fire Department. And Miss January 2010, Jaime Edmondson, plays in a league with fellowPlayboy playmates.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve heard of leagues in the White House and US Senate; leagues with all female lawyers, with Hollywood agents, and high stakes ones comprised of Vegas casino owners. David Bailey runs a 12-person league with six real-life couples. The trash talk gets pretty intense in that one. The cast of the Broadway playRock of Ages has a league, as does Petty Officer 2nd Class Dick Shayne Fossett and the squadron aboard the USS George H. W. Bush. Jay-Z plays in a high-stakes league with music producers, record execs, and the people who run the 40/40 club. In fact, many celebrities play. Saturday Night Live&#x2019;s Seth Meyers is a longtime player, as are actors Paul Rudd, Jason Bateman, Ashton Kutcher, and Elizabeth Banks. Daniel Radcliffe, &#x201c;Harry Potter&#x201d; himself, once told my podcast audience that Anquan Boldin was his &#x201c;Fantasy Voldemort.&#x201d; Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the pit-crew guys at Hendrick Motorsports have a league, and there are tons of high-stakes Wall Street leagues. Priests, Rabbis, and Ministers sounds like the start of a joke, but it&#x2019;s actually three different fantasy leagues I know of.</p><p>The best part of fantasy is that it gives people who normally would not have a reason to interact an excuse to talk. From the CEO and mailroom guys to long-lost cousins to everyone in between, they all have one thing in common:</p><p>Fantasy brings them together. And it keeps them together too. That feeling of belonging is certainly what drew me to the game.</p><p>From the time I was born in Denver to when we moved to Richmond, then Atlanta, then Charlottesville, Virginia, and finally to College Station, Texas, I had moved around a lot as a child by the age of 12. My big frizzy hair didn&#x2019;t help, nor did always being the new kid. Add thick glasses (I&#x2019;m nearly blind without contacts), plus a general sense of being socially awkward, and the prom king I wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Now, College Station is known for lots of things: Texas A&amp;M University, where my father is a professor, is the big one. The George Bush Presidential Library, its sister city of Bryan, Texas, and the fact that singer Lyle Lovett got his start there all make the Wikipedia page.</p><p>But among the things College Station is not known for?</p><p>Jewish kids.</p><p>Only a few handfuls of them live there, so that was yet another thing that made me feel different when I arrived. For as long as I live, I&#x2019;ll never forget one of my first days in Texas. I was sitting at lunch with some classmates, including a girl I had just met. It was during Passover week, and I mentioned that the odd bread I was eating was called &#x201c;matzoh&#x201d; and that I was Jewish:</p><p>ME: What?</p><p>HER: What what?</p><p>ME: You&#x2019;re staring at me.</p><p>HER (genuine curiosity): I&#x2019;m trying to see your horns.</p><p>ME: Horns?</p><p>HER: My dad said all Jewish people have them.</p><p>Half the table nodded. True story. Welcome to Texas, Berry.</p><p>So as a bit of an outcast, perhaps it was only natural that I would be drawn to a brand-new, niche game like fantasy baseball and that I was so willing to try something, anything . . . as long as it included me.</p><p>It was early spring in 1985, and I was actually a high school tennis player. Yes, that&#x2019;s right. In football-loving Texas, I played tennis, a sport you play without teammates. Looking back, it&#x2019;s amazing I had any friends at all.</p><p>I took tennis seriously. Won some tournaments, ranked as a USTA junior in the state of Texas, went to the state finals in high school, etc. This is only important to our tale for this lone fact:</p><p>As a result of being good at tennis, I took private tennis lessons. And that&#x2019;s only important because of the guy I took them from, the local tennis club pro, a man named Tommy V. Connell. Or as I prefer to call him, owner and general manager of the always plucky TV Sets.</p><p>I was walking up to see him for my lesson one day, and he was talking to his best friend, a guy I would later come to know as Beloved Commissioner for Life Don Smith, owner of the Smith Ereens. They were talking in a strange language that felt newly familiar, and going through names of guys they could ask &#x201c;to join.&#x201d; What they were discussing would set my life on a course I&#x2019;d never imagined.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you guys talking about Rotisserie League Baseball?&#x201d;</p><p>They were just as shocked that I knew what they were talking about as I was that anyone besides me read Rotisserie League Baseball, a weird little green book that had just been released detailing the rules, spirit, and advice about how to play &#x201c;The Greatest Game for Baseball Fans Since Baseball.&#x201d;</p><p>Don, Tommy, and their friends were forming a league, and they needed a 10th guy who had both heard of this weird thing and was willing to try it. It was to be a National League&#x2013;only fantasy baseball league. They would have to do stats by hand because in 1985 there was no Internet, no one had cell phones, and people still bought magazines for their porn.</p><p>I was 14 years old.</p><p>The other guys in the league were in their twenties and thirties, and I was a freshman in high school. But we&#x2019;ve all been in leagues where you just need one more guy&#x2014;any guy&#x2014;to play, and that first year the Fat Dog Rotisserie League was no exception.</p><p>I joined because it seemed like a helluva lot of fun.</p><p>Almost 30 years later, I can confirm it is, in fact, ONE HELL. OF A LOT. OF FUN.</p><p>Fifteen years after my initial fantasy auction (blurrily pictured here), I would get my first job writing about fantasy sports. Four and a half years after that, I would start TalentedMrRoto.com, and in 2006, just a scant 22 years after this picture was taken, I sold the site and came to ESPN as its senior director of fantasy sports.</p><p>Along the way, a bunch of things happened. There were wars and presidents, and apparently some big wall overseas fell at some point, but probably most important, fantasy sports became not just mainstream but a way of life.</p><p>Fantasy sports are popular for lots of reasons. The competition with your friends, family, and even strangers. The rooting interest it gives us in sporting events we would normally never care about or the athletes we never dreamed of cheering for. The ease of it, thanks to the Internet and other technology.</p><p>But more than anything, it&#x2019;s fun.</p><p>For many people&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m in this group&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all about your league. The guys and gals who are your league-mates. The good times, the bad times, the highs and the lows, it all comes back to someone&#x2019;s league. A bad league ruins the experience for so many, which is why I was so lucky that the Fat Dogs, my original league, is such a great one.</p><p>It&#x2019;s where I learned not only how to play but how to play the right way, to enjoy the game with a good group of guys who want to win, sure, but who mainly just want to laugh and have fun.</p><p>We draft on the same days every year. (Traditions are crucial for any good league.) The Friday after opening day we do the Lone Star American League auction (started the year after the Fat Dogs). Then on Saturday we do the National League. We sit in order of last year&#x2019;s standings, with the champion at the head of the table, second place sitting to his right, third next to second, and so forth.</p><p>Twelfth place gets to throw the first guy out for auction, and the pizza is delivered promptly at 12:30. Even though I live in Connecticut now, I fly back to College Station every year. That&#x2019;s right&#x2014;the league still exists.</p><p>In fact, get this: 6 of the original 10 guys from 1985 are, many, many years later, still in the Fat Dog League. And two others have been in it for 20-plus years. For all the amazing advances the Internet has made to help the growth, popularity, and ease of fantasy sports, I see one major downside. That folks no longer have to be in the same room to draft. It&#x2019;s just not the same.</p><p>Especially when you get to draft with people you&#x2019;ve known for more than a quarter-century. Because when you do something embarrassing at the draft&#x2014;and we all have over the years&#x2014;it gets remembered. Forever. And the amount of trash talk is both hilarious and awe-inspiring.</p><p>To this day, fellow Fat Dogger Woody Thompson, owner of the Thompson Twins, is reminded of the year he tried to draft promising youngster Ryan Howard to his minor league team, only to be told Howard was already owned. By him.</p><p>When we started, we didn&#x2019;t draft with personal computers because they didn&#x2019;t exist. Standings came once a week . . . by mail.</p><p>As for transactions, well, let Beloved Former Commissioner for Life Don Smith tell you.</p><p>&#x201c;Originally, if someone wanted a player, they just called the commissioner. First to get to me, first served. Anyway, one Monday during that first year I was sitting in my office, and I heard a commotion. My brother Terry, owner of Smitty&#x2019;s Grills, was running down the hall with his five-year-old daughter in tow. &#x2018;C&#x2019;mon, Heather, hurry, we&#x2019;ve got to see Uncle Don! Hurry!&#x2019; There were no cell phones, of course; it was about 8:30 AM, and he was taking her to school, but he&#x2019;d heard on the radio that San Diego had a new starting outfielder. He was huffing and puffing, dragging his kid into my office. &#x2018;I claim Carmelo Martinez!&#x2019; he wheezed as his confused daughter looked at her out-of-breath father. The Grills got their outfielder but Heather didn&#x2019;t make it to school on time. And we enjoyed the craziness of that moment for the next 26 years.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, we did, Don, and it was with great sadness to all the Fat Dogs when Terry passed away in March of 2011. I&#x2019;ll never forget Terry dragging his young daughter down the hall.</p><p>You know, since that first year, I&#x2019;ve lost my glasses and a good chunk of the hair, I&#x2019;ve gained experience, perspective, and weight, but most important, I have played in hundreds of fantasy leagues covering all kinds of sports and entertainment. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I even played fantasy hockey once. What can I say? I was young and experimental.</p><p>But the best league I&#x2019;ve ever played in is still the first one. As a league, we&#x2019;ve been through marriages and births, heart attacks and deaths, and a three-week email war over who owned Manny Ramirez. They are great guys, they are pains in the ass, and I wouldn&#x2019;t trade my sense of community with them for the world. Recently, in a public study, ESPN found that the average sports fan spends more than six hours a week with ESPN on one of our many platforms&#x2014;TV, radio, dot-com, the magazine, our mobile apps, etc.</p><p>But the average fantasy player?</p><p>He or she spends over 18 hours a week with ESPN. Almost a full day a week!</p><p>Oh yeah, people are into it. But while stats like that are impressive and speak to the broad appeal of fantasy, the truth is it&#x2019;s all about the people. It&#x2019;s not the draft, it&#x2019;s not the trash talk or the punishments, it&#x2019;s not even the winning (okay, maybe it&#x2019;s a little bit the winning). It&#x2019;s the people. It&#x2019;s the people who make the draft and the trash talk and the punishments and the winning what it is.</p><p>Consider the story of Kevin Hanzlik from Northfield, Minnesota. His team, Hanzie&#x2019;s Heroes, lost in the finals of his 2011 10-team fantasy football league. It happens. The fact that he lost to his 87-year-old mother, Pat Hanzlik? Not as common. Grandma Pat, as she is known, rode Cam Newton&#x2019;s rookie year ...</p></p><h2>Love, Nina: A Nanny Writes Home</h2><p><strong>"Breezy, sophisticated, hilarious, rude and aching with sweetness: LOVE, NINA might be the most charming book I've ever read." --Maria Semple, author of <em>Where'd You Go, Bernadette<br></em><br></strong>In 1982, 20-year-old Nina Stibbe moved to London to work as a nanny to two opinionated and lively young boys. In frequent letters home to her sister, Nina described her trials and triumphs: there's a cat nobody likes, suppertime visits from a famous local playwright, a mysteriously unpaid milk bill, and repeated misadventures parking the family car. Dinner table discussions cover the gamut, from the greats of English literature, to swearing in German, to sexually transmitted diseases. There's no end to what Nina can learn from these boys (rude words) and their broad-minded mother (the who's who of literary London).<br><br>A charming, hilarious, sweetly inspiring celebration of bad food and good company, <i>Love, Nina</i> makes a young woman's adventures in a new world come alive.</p><p>Nina Stibbe, after leaving her work as a nanny and attending university, worked in publishing. She now lives in Cornwall with her husband and their two children."I went back to listen to the audiobook of <em>Love, Nina</em> again, and again, I honked like a goose through the whole thing."&#x2015;<b><i>Ann Patchett, author of <em>The Dutch House</em> and <em>Bel Canto</em></i></b><br><br>"My feel-good recipe is to have a top self-help book on the go together with a novel with a light and jolly perspective on life. On the novel front, anything by P.G. Wodehouse never fails, but this year, <i>Love Nina: A Nanny Writes Home </i>worked just the same magic."&#x2015;<b><i>Helen Fielding, author of <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i><br></i></b><br><br>"I adored this book, and I could quote from it forever. It's real, odd, life-affirming, sharp, loving...and I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so frequently while reading."&#x2015;<b>Nick Hornby</b>, <b><i><em>The Believer</em></i></b><br><br>"[<i>Love, Nina</i> is] observant, funny, terse, at times a bit rude. It affords a glimpse into a rarefied London social and literary milieu...These letters are winning from the start...we simply like being in Ms. Stibbe's company."&#x2015;<b><i>Dwight Garner, <em>The New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"I have never laughed so hard reading a book. Nina Stibbe's recollections of life as a London nanny are both hilarious and heartwarming."&#x2015;<b><i>J. Courtney Sullivan, author of <em>Maine</em> and <em>The Engagements</em></i></b><br><br>"I must MOST EARNESTLY recommend <i>Love, Nina</i> by Nina Stibbe. It's the most piss-funny thing I've read all year. I can't remember a book since Adrian Mole that so brilliantly, drily nailed day-to-day life in BRILLIANT, faux-naive prose."&#x2015;<b><i>Caitlin Moran, author of <i>How to Build a Girl</i></i></b><br><br>"Nina Stibbe is the funniest new writer to arrive in years. LOVE, NINA is a memoir so warm, so witty and so wise, it's like finding the friend you always deserved."&#x2015;<b><i>Andrew O'Hagan, author of <em>Be Near Me</em> and <em>Missing</em></i></b><br><br>"What a funny, artist-filled life she lived, and how well she watched and participated.

In gratitude for saving his life, Eric hires Clare to create the most expensive coffee blend on the planet.

This particular bomb was aimed at techno-wunderkind Eric Thorner, whose life is saved by quick-thinking Clare. Thorners&#x2019; driver, however, isn&#x2019;t so lucky. Thorner thanks Clare for his life with a dream brewing machine and an opportunity to help create the world&#x2019;s most expensive coffee. The project entails jetting about the world in search of the perfect bean, but, while Clare is impressed by life in the fast lane, all she really wants is to be with her cop-boyfriend, Mike. Meanwhile, she tries to determine who planted the bomb, and when further mayhem strikes, it&#x2019;s clear that she&#x2019;s getting closer. Imaginative recipes and fascinating coffee details surround the mystery with an appealing aroma. Foodie mystery fans will savor this one along with titles by Julie Hyzy and Laura Childs. --Amy Alessio</p><h2>Lowcountry Bordello (A Liz Talbot Mystery) (Volume 4)</h2><p><p><b>USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR and AGATHA AWARD-WINNING SERIES</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;The authentically Southern Boyer writes with heart, insight, and a deep understanding of human nature.&#x201d; &#x2013; Hank Phillippi Ryan, Agatha Award-Winning Author of<i> What You See</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Boyer deftly shapes characters with just enough idiosyncrasies without succumbing to cliches while infusing her lighthearted plot with an insightful look at families.&#x201d; &#x2013; Oline Cogdill, <i>South Florida Sun Sentinel</i></p><p>&#x201c;Southern family eccentricities and manners, a very strongly plotted mystery, and a heroine who must balance her nuptials with a murder investigation ensure that readers will be vastly entertained by this funny and compelling mystery.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Kings River Life Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;An exciting, humorous mystery...authentically Southern.

In one memorable essay, Bruno Bettelheim argues that Anne's family brought disaster upon themselves by their determination to ignore reality and live as if things were normal. In another, Leo Marx considers the Huckleberry Finn controversy, concluding that teachers are best qualified to decide if their students should read Huck, because they know "their own ability to convey, and their students' ability to grasp, the irony that informs every word of this matchless comic novel."

Concerned with the mutual entanglements of indigenous and nonindigenous worlds, and the partial connections between them, de la Cadena presents how the Turpos' indigenous ways of knowing and being include and exceed modern and nonmodern practices. Her discussion of indigenous political strategies&#x2014;a realm that need not abide by binary logics&#x2014;reconfigures how to think about and question modern politics, while pushing her readers to think beyond "hybridity" and toward translation, communication that accepts incommensurability, and mutual difference as conditions for ethnography to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Marisol de la Cadena is Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis, and the author of <i>Indigenous Mestizos: The Politics of Race and Culture in Cuzco, Peru, 1919&#x2013;1991</i>, also published by Duke University Press."While theoretically sophisticated, the book&#x2019;s concrete language and brief introductory asides make it suitable for advanced undergraduates unfamiliar with its core concepts."&nbsp; (Carwil Bjork-James <i>Anthropological Quarterly</i> 2016-02-01)<br><br>"<i>Earth Beings</i> is essential reading for those following current research on relational&nbsp;ontologies and the importance of other-than-human contributions to society (<i>ayllu</i>) by&nbsp;encouraging us to think about how beings, places, knowledges, and power interact,&nbsp;particularly in the Peruvian Andes, but in a way that is relevant to much of South&nbsp;America and beyond....&nbsp;[T]he exceptional&nbsp;ethnographic narratives and the clarity of writing make this a monograph that&nbsp;could be incorporated into a senior undergraduate or, more likely, a graduate level&nbsp;anthropology, geography, environmental studies, political sciences, or Indigenous&nbsp;studies class."

(Emily Yates-Doerr <i>Medicine Anthropology Theory</i> 2016-04-14)<br><br>"De la Cadena&#x2019;s book is an important read and a profound application of contemporary theory to Quechua struggles in South America. It is a moving yet challenging read where the discussions, specifically on cultural politics and representation, can be applied in numerous Indigenous contexts to better transform the relational mode of interactions and divisions between nature, humans and other- than- human entities within a political realm." (Agnieszka Pawlowska-Mainville <i>AlterNative</i> 2016-03-01)<br><br>"<i>Earth Beings</i> is a powerful ethnography, the result of more than a decade of fieldwork in the Peruvian Andes....

(Enrique Mayer <i>Journal of Anthropological Research</i> 2017-06-01)<br><br>"A remarkable achievement, not only merely in the compelling case it makes for ecologies of nature-humanity practices, but above all, at the level of method and authorship, where it models a concept of anthropology as of colaboring and writing 'from' rather than 'about' a specific place and land."

Odd S.

During those years, 94 percent of Norwegian emigrants landed in Canada.<br><br>After the introduction of free trade, Norwegian sailing ships engaged in the lucrative timber trade between Canada and the British Isles.

Lovoll explains the establishment and failure of Norwegian colonies in Quebec Province and pays due attention to the tragic fate of the Gasp� settlement.<br><br>A personal story of the emigrant experience passed down as family lore is retold here, supported by extensive research.

Everyone was somewhere else, doing last-�minute chores. The tall young man got out of his little green station wagon, stretched, looked around, took off his sunglasses, and started up the walk. Minnie Frederick, who saw him through her bedroom window, dropped the stack of sheets she was carrying and ran down the stairs. But he was not at the door, and when she went out onto the porch, he was nowhere to be seen. Back in the house, through the kitchen, out onto the stoop. Still nothing, apart from Jesse, her nephew, a noisy dot, cultivating the bean field east of the Osage-�orange hedge. She walked around the house to the front porch. The car was still there. She crossed to it and looked in the window. A pair of fancy boots in the foot well of the passenger&#x2019;s seat, two wadded-�up pieces of waxed paper, a soda can. She stood beside the green car for a long moment, then touched the hood. It was warm. It was real. She was not imagining things, sixty-�seven years old, she who came from a long line of crazy people on all sides, who was both happy and relieved to have chosen long ago not to reproduce. What, she thought, was the not-�crazy thing to do? It was to make a glass of iced tea and see if her sister, Lois, had left any shortbread in the cookie jar.<br><br>When had Lois first mentioned him&#x2014;�Charlie Wickett&#x2014;�sometime in January? But Minnie hadn&#x2019;t paid attention, because she was planning her summer trip to Rome. He was Tim&#x2019;s son, Lillian and Arthur&#x2019;s grandson, produced by means of one of those irresponsible high-�school romances that every principal was only too familiar with. The baby had ended up in St. Louis. Tim had ended up in Vietnam, killed by a grenade fragment. Charlie now lived in Aspen, said he would be happy to meet everyone, to drive to Denby, and within a week, a reunion had exploded around his coming. They were all heading to the farm&#x2014;�Frank and Andy, Michael and Richie with their wives and kids, Janet, alone (Minnie remembered that Janet had always had a thing about Tim), Arthur and Debbie and her kids (Hugh, her husband, couldn&#x2019;t come because of exams, though). There hadn&#x2019;t been a family gathering of this size since Claire&#x2019;s wedding&#x2014;�1962, that was. Minnie hoped everyone would mind their manners. She knew plenty of farm families who did not get along, but they kept their conflicts to themselves and behaved, at least in public. Families that had scattered, like the Langdons, could end up looking and acting like alien species of a single genus. Frank had nothing in common with Joe (never had), except that, thanks to Frank, the farm was paid off. Frank let Jesse and Joe work the land however they wished. Lillian, whom everyone had loved, had passed three and a half years before, and there was plenty of family gossip about what a mess Arthur and Debbie were. Dean kept to himself, and Tina, the youngest, had taken off to the mountains of Idaho. She wasn&#x2019;t coming (but she had driven down to Aspen, met Charlie, liked him, and issued a bulletin in the form of a drawing that depicted a handsome, laughing kid. How she had gotten the twinkle into his eye, Minnie didn&#x2019;t understand). For once, Henry was coming from Chicago (Minnie suspected that no one in Chicago knew that Henry was a farm kid). Only Claire, who was driving up from Des Moines, was a regular visitor. A big party. Lois was in charge of the cooking, Jen in charge of shopping, Joe in charge of the generous welcome. Minnie had done a lot of cleaning.<br><br>Now Charlie appeared on the other side of the screen door, loose-�limbed and fit. He saw her, he smiled, and Minnie said, &#x201c;I thought you were a phantom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I am sorry,&#x201d; said Charlie. &#x201c;When I got out of the car and realized how hot it was getting, I decided I had to take my run right away, so I ran around the section. What is that, do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four miles,&#x201d; said Minnie.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not used to the heat yet. But it&#x2019;s really flat, so that makes up for it a little.&#x201d;<br><br>She got up and opened the door. She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;d like some water.&#x201d;<br><br>She took a glass out of the drainer and held it under the tap. Not too brown. Lois had bought some kind of French sparkling water for the weekend, though Minnie was surprised you could get that sort of thing in Iowa. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth, poured it down. She didn&#x2019;t see the Langdon in him the way Frank had when he first espied him in a coffee shop in Aspen last fall, and, supposedly, was convinced the boy was a younger version of himself. Nor did she hear it in his voice (but, then, she hadn&#x2019;t spent much time with Tim). What she saw was grace and a ready smile. His eyes flicked here and there as he drank&#x2014;�he was no less observant than Frank, probably, but he looked like those kids she had known over the years whose parents were indulgent and easygoing, kids who understood that redemption was automatic.<br><br>Yes, she was charmed.<br><br>She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made the bed in your room. You can take your things up there and have a rest, if you&#x2019;d like. Everyone else should be home in a bit. Jen took Guthrie and Perky into town to Hy-�Vee, but she should be back any time.&#x201d; He filled his glass again and drank it down. She said, &#x201c;My name is Minnie Frederick; my sister, Lois, is married to your great-�uncle Joe. Gosh, we sound old! I&#x2019;m the dedicated aunt of Annie and Jesse, also a nosy neighbor, retired local principal, and arbiter of disputes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are we going to need one of those?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We should know by tomorrow evening.&#x201d;<br><br>The smile popped out. He said, &#x201c;I thought of bringing my protection squad along, but she had to work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your girlfriend?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;We heard about her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You did?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that you were followed, that your license-�plate number was jotted down, that your every move went into the photographic memory of Frank Langdon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When was that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Last September. You sold him boots, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie shook his head, but he didn&#x2019;t seem disconcerted. He looked at the ceiling moldings for a moment, then said, &#x201c;May I look around the house? My mom would love this house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a kit house from 1916. It arrived on the train, and my father, grandfather, and uncles helped put it together. There used to be lots of other houses around, including the Langdon place, which we could see from here, but that one had to be torn down. We had a one-�room schoolhouse within walking distance, but that&#x2019;s all gone now. In some places, there are a few trees where houses used to be.&#x201d; Minnie made herself stop talking, only said, &#x201c;But you look around, ask questions if you want. I&#x2019;m going to clean up in here a bit.&#x201d;<br><br>He went through the swinging door into the dining room. She tried to imagine how the place looked to him. Old, though not decrepit. Weighty? Awkwardly set into the tall-�grass prairie (maybe a sod hut would be more appropriate)? She had lived here her whole life, except for a few years in Cedar Falls, getting her teaching degree. Her parents had died here, and not easily&#x2014;�her mother had lingered for years after her stroke, with only Minnie to take care of her and Lois after her father disappeared, and then her father returned, full of drunken resolve to get something back that was owed him; Lois had found him at the bottom of the cellar stairs, his head smashed into the concrete. (What had he been looking for? Booze? Treasure? Revenge?) But if every day was spent in the same place, then bad days were overlaid by good ones, your home was just your home, there was no reason for restlessness. Even the story Minnie told herself, that she&#x2019;d always and only loved Frank, was a dusty remnant now that she had watched him habitually disregard the beautiful Andy, now that she&#x2019;d realized that the small value he placed on his wife had its source in him rather than her. If Frank had, by some miracle, appreciated Minnie, lo these forty years ago, and loved her, and married her instead of Andy, he would have estimated her, too, at less than her real value. It wasn&#x2019;t in him, whatever it was.<br><br>Charlie came back into the kitchen as Minnie was wiping down the sink. He said, &#x201c;Airy.&#x201d;<br><br>Minnie laughed. &#x201c;Well, exactly. But thanks for reminding me to shut the windows. We can keep out maybe five degrees of heat if we close the place down for the afternoon. Tonight might be okay; your room has a fan, at any rate. No air conditioner&#x2014;�sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t like air conditioners. My grandmother&#x2019;s lived in St. Louis for almost sixty years without an air conditioner. She believes in wringing a cloth out in cool water, then folding it across the back of your neck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She sounds enterprising. You do what you want. There&#x2019;s always plenty of food.

Janet was standing maybe a little too close to her cousin Debbie, but Debbie didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She was saying, &#x201c;Why would we ever see him again, now that he&#x2019;s seen us roast this hog? I mean, look at the smoke over the house, like a black cloud. Could it be any cruder?&#x201d; Debbie sneezed. They were in the kitchen&#x2014;�Janet slicing tomatoes, Debbie chopping celery. Through the window, Janet could see the whole family staring at the sizzling pig; of course her dad looked avid, but everyone else was smiling in anticipation, too. Janet had thought meringues and souffl�s were more Aunt Lois&#x2019;s sort of thing. Debbie went on, &#x201c;I mean, I was ready for Tim&#x2019;s doppelg�nger, you know? But I don&#x2019;t see it in this Charlie. And that&#x2019;s a relief.&#x201d; Janet did see it, though&#x2014;�the hips, the hair, the vocal timbre. Debbie said, &#x201c;I admit I was afraid at first, and to you, I will admit why&#x2014;�the comeback of the golden boy.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;But this is good for me. I&#x2019;ve come to terms with my own issues, which everyone has to do at some point, right?&#x201d;<br><br>Janet did not confess the waves of irrational hope that had broken over her these last few weeks. This Charlie would be something of a resurrection; would she adore him, would she embarrass herself? Her childhood worship of her cousin Tim was family legend. She said, &#x201c;I hope so.&#x201d; Charlie had turned out to be himself, in spite of his resemblance to Tim. And Janet had turned out to have no feelings toward Charlie other than regular first impressions. She said, &#x201c;At least he&#x2019;s not some stray product of my dad&#x2019;s youth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle Frank had a youth?&#x201d; They both smiled. &#x201c;Who said that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My mom,&#x201d; Janet said. &#x201c;She thinks of that as a joke.&#x201d; Debbie rolled her eyes. Janet said, &#x201c;Has anyone told Fiona?&#x201d; Janet remembered Fiona as Debbie&#x2019;s wild and intimidating equestrian girlfriend, much braver than any horsey girl Janet had known at Madeira or Sweet Briar. That Fiona had been at all interested in any boy, even Tim, and had gotten pregnant, was more than a little startling.<br><br>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; said Debbie.<br><br>&#x201c;How did she react?&#x201d;<br><br>Debbie spun toward her, knife in hand. &#x201c;She said, I quote, &#x2018;How interesting. Oh dear. There&#x2019;s the van. I&#x2019;ll call you.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did she ever call you?&#x201d;<br><br>Debbie shook her head.<br>he fit right in, thought Henry, who was standing on the back stoop, letting the breeze blow the stench from the roasting hog away from him. Extrovert, for sure. Charlie didn&#x2019;t just shake your hand, he patted you on the shoulder, looked you in the eye. From where he was standing on the porch, a little elevated, Henry could see the pattern&#x2014;�the kid would go from group to group, listen first, say something, listen again, his head bent slightly forward. When he was introduced to Henry, he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Oh, I hear you teach medieval literature! I took two semesters of that, and, you know, it wasn&#x2019;t what I expected.&#x201d; What had he expected? &#x201c;Well, you can imagine: the first book I ever read was The Once and Future King. I thought it would be lots of sorcerers, not so many monks.&#x201d; Charming, but he was not Henry&#x2019;s type. Were he to show up in, say, Henry&#x2019;s freshman lit class, Henry would prod him, treat him a little severely, imply all semester that Charlie Wickett wasn&#x2019;t putting anything past old Professor Langdon. The boy might rise to the occasion&#x2014;�sometimes they did. Minnie leaned out the door and said, &#x201c;Time to get organized!&#x201d; Everyone began moving toward the table.<br>emily said that she had to go to the bathroom, but it was just so that she could wait and see where her mom was sitting, and then sit somewhere else. The downstairs bathroom door was closed, though, so she went upstairs, and instead of going to the bathroom, she went through the baby&#x2019;s room and out to the back porch. From there she could see over the fields to the horizon, and she could imagine her favorite thing, which was flying. She didn&#x2019;t know how this had started, but maybe from dreaming. Now the dreams and the made-�up stuff were mixed up in her mind. She often thought about a myth they had read this year in her school, where a father figured out a way to fly (the book showed giant spreading wings, like eagle wings), but he put the wings together with wax, and when the son got too close to the sun, the wax melted, and the son fell into the ocean. Eli Grissom, who sat behind her in class, pointed out that the son&#x2014;�Icarus, his name was (Eli pronounced it &#x201c;EYE-�carus&#x201d;)&#x2014;�could not have gotten ninety-�three million miles in ten minutes, if at all, but in spite of Eli, Emily imagined it almost every day, the wings catching an updraft, the boy feeling himself lifted, the warmth and the brightness all around. It was too bad, Emily thought, that he didn&#x2019;t remember how birds bend their necks and fold their wings and swoop downward&#x2014;�maybe he was so excited that, when the wax started melting and the feathers dropped away, he didn&#x2019;t notice it in time. Emily rested her hands on the sill and leaned toward the window. The horizon was a beautiful thing, she thought.</p><h2>Catwoman Vol. 2: Far From Gotham</h2><p><b>Eisner Award-nominated creator Jo�lle Jones continues her landmark series featuring the all-new Selina Kyle in <i>Catwoman Vol. 2</i>!</b><br><br>ENTER THE PENGUIN<br><br>She broke up with the Batman by leaving him at the altar of their would-be wedding.

He said that rhythm was allowing yourself to feel your blood coursing through you. He told me to close my eyes and forget the rest of my body. I did, and we bopped our nonexistent selves up and down and side to side. He liked me because I was a quiet child. He showed me photographs of himself as a boy. He referred to himself in the third person. This here is Harper Evan Burch, he would say. The boy in those photographs was also a quiet child. I could tell from the way that his arms were always flat by his side, never akimbo or raised high to the North Carolina sky. We were both compact, always folding ourselves into smaller pieces. We both liked music because it was a river where we stripped down, jumped in, and flailed our arms around. It was 1975 then, and the water everywhere around us was glittery with disco lights. My great-uncle Harper and I, though, danced to Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Fats Domino. We twisted, mashed- potatoed, and winked at each other whenever we opened our eyes. My great-uncle Harper was my first love. I was seven years old. In his company, I laughed out loud.<br><br>I'm not ashamed to admit that I have tried to find him in the male bodies that I lie next to and that I see him now only when I turn off the lights. His bow tie undone, hanging around his shirt collar-modest isosceles triangles, considering the fashion at the time, his pants cuffed and creased, his graying hair cut the same as when he was a boy, a wedge of it hanging over one eye, the other one a blue lake dappled by the sun.<br><br>My great-uncle Harper wasn't where I thought I would begin, but a family narrative should begin with love. Because he was my first love I was spared the saddest experience in most people's lives. My first love and my first heartbreak were dealt by different pairs of hands. I was lucky. My memories of the two sensations, one of my heart filling and one of it emptying, were divided and lodged in separate bodies. I can still recall the feeling that came over me when my great-uncle Harper first placed the record needle onto a spinning 45. It happened right away. I felt that everything deep within my body was rising to the surface, that my skin was growing thin, that I would come apart. If this sounds painful, it wasn't. It was what love did to my body, which was to transform it. I would come apart like a fireworks display, a burst of light that would grow larger and glow, and make the person below me say, "Ah!" I remembered saying my great-uncle's name aloud. This memory of my first love was then safe from all that was to come.<br><br>I'll tell you the easy things first. I'll use simple sentences. So factual and flat, these statements will land in between us like playing cards on a table: My name is Linda Hammerick. I grew up in Boiling Springs, North Carolina. My parents were Thomas and DeAnne. My best friend was named Kelly. I was my father's tomboy. I was my mother's baton twirler. I was my high school's valedictorian. I went far away for college and law school. I live now in New York City. I miss my great-uncle Harper.<br><br>But once these cards have been thrown down, there are bound to be distorting overlaps, the head of the Queen of Spades on the body of the King of Clubs, the Joker's bowed legs beneath a field of hearts: I grew up in (Thomas and Kelly). My parents were (valedictorian and baton twirler). My best friend was named (Harper). I was my father's (New York City). I was my mother's (college and law school). I was my high school's (tomboy). I went far away for (Thomas and DeAnne). I live now in (Boiling Springs). I miss (Linda Hammerick). The only way to sort out the truth is to pick up the cards again, slowly, examining each one.<br><br>My grandmother Iris Burch Whatley died on February 14, 1987. She had never told a lie, and the fear of that had kept our family, a shrinking brood, together. As her health began to fail, we began to show our true colors. When she passed away, we bloomed like the petals of an heirloom rose, which then faded and fell to pieces. Iris was my mother's mother and my great-uncle Harper's older sister.<br><br>For a woman on her deathbed, my grandmother Iris looked remarkably pulled together. Her eyebrows had been freshly drawn in. Her lips were a frosted coral. Her gray hair had just been done in a modified, somewhat modernized bouffant. She had a visiting nurse and a visiting beautician. They were some of the perks of dying at home.<br><br>What I know about you, little girl, would break you in two. Those were the last words that my grandmother ever said to me.<br><br>Bitch, I said back to her in a voice as calm as if she had asked me for the time and I, standing by her bedside, had replied, Noon.<br><br>My great-uncle Harper let out a single hiccup, which was his way of suppressing a laugh. My grandmother's milky blue eyes closed and didn't open up again, according to my great-uncle, until a full minute later. DeAnne (that was what I called my mother by then) took that time to whisper, Hush your mouth, Linda. Then she pointed an outraged finger at the door, which I slammed shut on my way out.<br><br>For DeAnne, that exchange was a final excruciating example of what her seventy-four-year-old mother and her nineteen-year-old daughter had in common. My grandmother Iris and I were both speaking the truth, and DeAnne couldn't stand to hear it.<br><br>DeAnne had called me home from college to say my goodbyes:<br><br>Take a plane, Linda. For God's sake, don't take the bus again.<br><br>Are you sure this time? I've three exams next week-<br><br>I'll pay for the ticket.<br><br>Fine.<br><br>That was the longest conversation DeAnne and I had had in months. I loved my mother from the age of seven to eleven. That was four good years we had together, which was longer than most marriages. I would learn that bit of statistics in my sophomore psychology class, The American Family at the End of the 20th Century: Dysfunction, Dysfunction, What's Your Function? During my four years at Yale, I would gravitate toward classes with the word dysfunction featured prominently in the title or repeated at least several times in the course descriptions. I also would wish with every bone in my body that my father was still alive so that I could share with him what I had learned.<br><br>When my father died (he preceded Iris, to my great regret), he and DeAnne had been married for almost twenty-five years, many of them happy. The "happy" part was also according to my great-uncle Harper. I saw only the other parts. There was no physical violence or sobs or expletives. There was only unhappiness. I had no older brothers and sisters to report to me of better times: Mom and Dad used to give each other a kiss between saying "good" and "morning"; Dad tied on an apron every Sunday night and made grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup from a can; Mom stayed in the kitchen with him and flipped through a magazine. All of that, if it took place, was lost to me.<br><br>I don't know why but I knew that my father was going to leave me too soon. So I missed him even when he was alive. Every time he left town on business, usually just an overnight trip to Raleigh, I would catch a cold. When he came back home, I would get well. For his part, my father never thought about missing me. Of course, he would be there to see me graduate from high school, attend his alma maters, enter the profession that nourished him, live in the city that he shared with me at bedtime in lieu of a fairy tale.<br><br>My grandmother Iris's funeral was delayed by a week because of the flowers. After her second heart attack, Iris had told us that she wanted magnolias on her coffin. Boughs and boughs of them, a cascading river of glossy green leaves with brown suede undersides, creamy blossoms the size of soup bowls floating among them. Iris didn't go into such details, but that was how my great-uncle Harper had envisioned the flowers when his sister told him what she expected. But in the middle of February, there weren't any magnolias to be had in Boiling Springs or anywhere else in the state of North Carolina. The florist in nearby Shelby had to special-order them from a wholesaler in New York City, who had to wait for a midweek shipment from somewhere in South America before the branches could be overnighted to Boiling Springs in a box almost as large as my grandmother's coffin. Baby Harper (that was what my grandmother had called her little brother since the day he was born, and that was sixty-three years ago by then) made all the funeral arrangements, and he would be the first to say that the flowers were the most complex and challenging part of it all. He took copious notes. Do's and don'ts for when his day came:<br><br>F Do have the wake at the Cecil T. Brandon Home of Eternal Rest; ask for the "Dignified Departure" package.<br><br>F Don't waste money on real flowers; one dead thing is enough.<br><br>F Do use a caterer from Asheville; see folder labeled "Victuals" for phone numbers and addresses.<br><br>F Don't place an order for the deviled eggs; they are delicious, but the old people will pass gas.<br><br>My great-uncle made a folder for his notes, showed it to me, and then alphabetized it in his personal files under T for "The End."<br><br>Before his retirement my great-uncle Harper was a librarian at Gardner- Webb Baptist College, the intellectual hub of Boiling Springs. At work his methodology was conventional and efficient, but that wasn't the case in his own home. His books were shelved in alphabetical order but not by titles. A for "Acerbic," B for "Buy Another Copy as Gift," C for "Cow Dung, as in This Stinks," D for "Devastating," E for "Explore Further," F for "Foreign" (foreign meant that my great-uncle couldn't relate to the characters in the book, not that the author was from another country), and so on. He would explain the system to me and give me typewritten pages identifying all twenty-six categories. This and his "The End" folder would be the closest documents to a will that Baby Harper (he had admitted to me long ago that he liked being called that, even when his sister, Iris, wasn't around) would ever prepare. When Iris passed away, my great-uncle had never left the continental United States, and the acquisition of the magnolias for her coffin made him think about places in the world even more southern than where he was born and raised. That thought sent him to the bookstore, where he bought a couple of travel guides and a novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. Baby Harper filed these books under E.<br><br>My grandmother Iris was what her doctor called a "brittle" diabetic. During the course of a given day, her blood sugar levels would spike and then plunge precipitously. This roller-coastering exerted a tremendous amount of stress on her internal organs, especially her heart. She was lucky to have lived so long after the onset of the disease. The diagnosis of her diabetes had coincided with the fifth anniversary of the death of her husband, Walter Wendell Whatley. I have no memories of my grandfather, or Judge Whatley, as the rest of the county called him. Fifteen years my grandmother Iris lived on in Boiling Springs without him. After the first ten on her own, she told me that she wasn't lucky to have lived so long. She knew that I was the only one in her family who wasn't unnerved by her honesty.<br><br>Sadness attacked my grandmother at the weakest point of her body-her mouth. She loved her husband, but she had always lusted for sugar. While Walter Wendell was still alive, she stayed away from sweets, particularly the doughy and fried variety, in order to keep his eyes on her figure. Her dress size, a respectable eight, and her hairdo, a shoulder-length froth that required twice-weekly visits to Miss Cora's Beauty Emporium, had remained unchanged from the day that she had met Walter Wendell. Once he passed on, there was no good reason for her to stay the same. She cut several inches off her hair, setting her short locks in hot rollers by herself unless it was a special occasion. She also crammed herself with jelly doughnuts, apple fritters, cinnamon twists, and chocolate-covered crullers. The closest Krispy Kreme-she liked the one-stop shopping-was across the state line in Spartanburg, South Carolina. My great-uncle Harper told me that during the first year of Iris's solitary life in the green-shuttered colonial on Piedmont Street, she drove the thirty-eight miles between Boiling Springs and Spartanburg so often that she could do it in the darkness of the predawn with her eyes closed, dreaming of Walter Wendell.<br><br>As with most addicts, my grandmother Iris liked to share the experience. She was the one who gave me my first full bottle of Dr Pepper, straight from the fridge, not even bothering with a glass. I was seven at the time (already dancing with my great-uncle Harper), and I thought it was the beginning of something great between my grandmother and me. Iris took out a bottle for herself, and with three swigs she emptied every drop of its molasses-colored liquid.<br><br>Don't tell anyone, she said as she dabbed the corners of her mouth with a paper napkin.<br><br>About the Dr Pepper? I asked.<br><br>No, you little canary, she replied. About how I let you drink it straight from the bottle.<br><br>I remembered looking down at what was cold in my hands. There were sweat beads rolling down the glass bottle, just like in a television commercial. The bottle was still almost full. The initial rush of carbonation had burned my tongue, so I was trying to sip it slowly. Thanks to my grandmother Iris I had learned an important lesson: The difference between a fact and a secret was the slithery phrase "Don't tell anyone." I felt like pouring my Dr Pepper into the sink. I went out to the backyard of my grandmother's house and soaked the roots of her dogwood tree with it instead.</p><h2>The Holy Science</h2><p>2013 Reprint of 1949 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Yukteshwar was an educator, astronomer, a Jyotisha (Vedic astrologer), a yogi, and a believer in the Bhagavad Gita and the Bible. He was a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya of Varanasi and a member of the Giri branch of the swami order. Yogananda considered Yukteswar as Jnanavatar, or &#34;Incarnation of Wisdom&#34;. Yukteswar wrote &#34;The Holy Science&#34; in 1894. In the introduction, he wrote: &#34;The purpose of this book is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.&#34; The work introduced many ideas that were revolutionary for the time - for instance Yukteswar broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dwapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes. He also introduced the idea that the sun takes a &#39;star for its dual&#39;, and revolves around it in a period of 24,000 years, which accounts for the precession of the equinox.</p><p>(From the Preface to Autobiography of a Yogi by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc., Jesus College, Oxford: Author and translator of many classic works on yoga and the wisdom traditions of the East, including Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, Tibet s Great Yogi Milarepa, and The Tibetan Book of the Dead.)<br> It has been my privilege to meet one of the sages whose life history is herein narrated Sri Yukteswar Giri....It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples....Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration that his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, robed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic....I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquility to that ideal life which Paramahansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages.</p><h2>The New Robert&#39;s Rules of Order: Completely Revised, Updated, and Expanded for the New Millennium</h2><p>The bestselling reference title has been updated and revised.

What can probability theory teach us about free will? Can mathematical notions be used to enhance one's personal understanding of the Bible?<br><br>Perhaps no one is more qualified to address these questions than Donald E. Knuth, whose massive contributions to computing have led others to nickname him "The Father of Computer Science"&#x2014;and whose religious faith led him to understand a fascinating analysis of the Bible called the 3:16 project. In this series of six spirited, informal lectures, Knuth explores the relationships between his vocation and his faith, revealing the unique perspective that his work with computing has lent to his understanding of God.<br><br>His starting point is the 3:16 project, an application of mathematical "random sampling" to the books of the Bible. The first lectures tell the story of the project's conception and execution, exploring its many dimensions of language translation, aesthetics, and theological history. Along the way, Knuth explains the many insights he gained from such interdisciplinary work. These theological musings culminate in a surprising final lecture tackling the ideas of infinity, free will, and some of the other big questions that lie at the juncture of theology and computation.<br><br><i>Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About</i>, with its charming and user-friendly format&#x2014;each lecture ends with a question and answer exchange, and the book itself contains more than 100 illustrations&#x2014;is a readable and intriguing approach to a crucial topic, certain to edify both those who are serious and curious about their faiths and those who look at the science of computation and wonder what it might teach them about their spiritual world.<br><br>Includes "Creativity, Spirituality, and Computer Science," a panel discussion featuring Harry Lewis, Guy L. Steele, Jr., Manuela Veloso, Donald E. Knuth, and Mitch Kapor.</p><p><b>Donald E. Knuth</b> is a Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University and author of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>. These lectures were originally presented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and broadcast live on the Internet.In a series of six lectures delivered at MIT from October 6 to December 8, 2001, Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming), the "father of computer science," ranges over topics from free will and divine design to aesthetics and the complexities of language translation. Yet the centerpiece of the lectures is Knuth's explanation of his earlier book, 3:16: Bible Texts Illuminated (1990), in which he examined the Bible by analyzing the third chapter and 16th verse of each book. In each lecture, Knuth explores various aspects of that project, such as the ways that the random selection of "3:16" functions as a method for understanding the overall thematic threads of biblical meaning and exposes the intersections of faith and computer science. Knuth delivers each lecture in a breezy, informal style and follows up with a brief question-and-answer section. But the conclusions that he reaches are vague and simplistic, e.g., "the Bible verses I studied were constantly interesting and full of stimulation" and "God definitely wants people to be actively searching for better understanding of life's mysteries." If these lectures are any indication, readers will be grateful that religion is one of the things that computer scientists rarely talk about. In addition, since this book is simply a transcription of Knuth's lectures, it is recommended only for large academic libraries. Henry L.

When the controversial reform-minded Bishop of London is found bludgeoned to death in an ancient crypt beside the corpse of an unidentified man murdered decades before, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, reluctantly agrees to investigate. As his search for the killer leads him from the back alleys of Smithfield to the power corridors of Whitehall, Sebastian must confront the well-guarded secrets of his own family's past&#x2014;and a devastating truth that could ultimately force him to question who&#x2014;and what&#x2014;he really is.</p><p>Watch a Video</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p></p><p>C.S. Harris graduated with a degree in Classics before earning a Ph.D. in European history. A scholar of the French Revolution and 19th-century Europe, she has lived in Europe and various far-flung parts of the old British Empire. She now lives in New Orleans with her husband, a retired Army Intelligence Officer, and two daughters.Long-festering family secrets, treachery and worse threaten Sebastian St. Cyr in Harris's addictive fifth Regency-era mystery starring the dashing soldier-turned-sleuth (after 2008's <i>Where Serpents Sleep</i>). From the start, St. Cyr's mission is sensitive: finding out who killed the bishop of London, a leading candidate for archbishop of Canterbury, in the crypt of the same country church where the mummified body of another murder victim was discovered only hours earlier. It becomes downright dangerous once the charismatic viscount unearths the surprising connection between the men as well as the many powerful enemies with motives for their murder&#x2014;including his own father. Harris weaves palpable period detail and romantic subplots with such ease that her occasional descriptive laziness, such as repeats of fiercely blue St. Cyr eyes, grates inordinately. But it shouldn't keep you from being swept up by her seductive antihero at his swashbuckling best. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It includes a background note about the book, an author&#39;s biography, and a lively afterword. Acclaimed by educators nationwide, the Townsend Library is helping millions of young adults discover the pleasure and power of reading.</p><p>First published in 1919, Albert Payson Terhune's <i>Lad: A Dog</i> is actually a collection of immensely popular magazine stories. The hero is an extraordinary collie named Lad, "a thoroughbred in spirit as well as in blood." In each tale, Lad exhibits his pure strength of character as he fights off burglars, rescues an invalid child from a poisonous snake, wins ribbons in dog shows, and otherwise leads a dog-hero's life. This is a period piece--a threatened puppy is described, for example, as "a blinking pygmy who gallantly essayed to growl defiance"--and that touch of fustian is all part of Terhune's enduring charm. Because the stories didn't originally appear together, there's considerable repetition: nearly every story with a fight scene has the same authorial mini-lecture on the difference in fighting technique between collies and bulldogs. But Lad is a character who has poked his muzzle into a million hearts, and new generations of dog lovers will also appreciate his loyalty and courage. As Terhune himself wrote, "few... bothered to praise the stories, themselves. But all of them praised Lad, which pleased me far better." (Ages 6 and older) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Before there was Lassie, there was Lad--a dog whose loyalty and courage set him apart. Since its original publication over 70 years ago, Terhune&#39;s classic has touched countless readers. Lad is based upon one of Terhune&#39;s many collies. --townsendpress.com</p><h2>The Ongoing Moment</h2><p><p>Great photographs change the way we see the world;&nbsp;<i>The Ongoing Moment&nbsp;</i>changes the way we look at both.<br><br>Focusing on the ways in which canonical figures like Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Walker Evans, Andr� Kert�sz, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus, and William Eggleston have photographed the same things&#x2014;barber shops, benches, hands, roads, signs&#x2014;award-winning writer Geoff Dyer seeks to identify their signature styles.

His books have been translated into twenty-four languages.</p>I am not the first researcher to draw inspiration from a &#x2018;certain Chinese encyclopaedia&#x2019; described by Borges. According to this arcane work &#x2018;animals are divided into: (a) those that belong to the Emperor; (b) embalmed ones; (c) those that are trained; (d) suckling pigs; (e) mermaids; (f) fabulous ones; (g) stray dogs; (h) those that are included in this classification; (i) those that tremble as if they were mad; (j) innumerable ones; (k) those drawn with a very fine camel&#x2019;s-hair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) those that have just broken the flower vase; (n) those that at distance resemble flies.&#x2019;<br><br>While the survey of photography undertaken in these pages can claim neither this degree of rigour nor eccentricity, it takes heart from earlier, well-intended attempts to marshal the infinite variety of photographic possibilities into some kind of haphazard order. Walker Evans said it was &#x2018;a pet subject&#x2019; of his &#x2013; how writers like James Joyce and Henry James were &#x2018;unconscious photographers&#x2019;. In the case of Walt Whitman there was nothing unconscious about it. &#x2018;In these Leaves [of Grass] every thing is literally photographed,&#x2019; he insisted. &#x2018;Nothing is poeticized.&#x2019; Keen to emulate the &#x2018;Priests of the Sun&#x2019;, Whitman created poems that, at times, read like extended captions in a huge, constantly evolving catalogue of photographs:<br>See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,<br><br>See, the many-cylinder&#x2019;d steam-printing-press &#x2013; see, the electric telegraph stretching across the continent, [. . .]<br><br>See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing the steam-whistle,<br><br>See ploughmen ploughing farms &#x2013; see, miners digging mines &#x2013; see, the numberless factories,<br><br>See mechanics busy at their benches with tools [. . .]<br>For his part Evans, in 1934, compiled a list of picture categories as a way of clarifying his own ideas about what he was trying to do in his work:<br>People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out.<br><br>Automobiles and the automobile landscape.<br><br>Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, clubs, the city atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women&#x2019;s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay.<br><br>The movies.<br><br>Evidence of what people of the city read, eat, see for amusement, do for relaxation and not get it.<br><br>Sex.<br><br>Advertising.<br><br>A lot else, you see what I mean.<br>The cultural historian Alan Trachtenberg has pointed out that this list calls to mind Lewis Hine&#x2019;s earlier Catalogue of Social and Industrial Photographs, &#x2018;only seasoned with Evans&#x2019;s irony&#x2019;. But it&#x2019;s more than irony that sets the two endeavours apart. Hine&#x2019;s is an entirely logical and rigorous listing &#x2013; &#x2018;Immigrants&#x2019;, &#x2018;Women Workers at Work&#x2019;, &#x2018;Men Workers at Work&#x2019;, &#x2018;Incidents of a Worker&#x2019;s Life&#x2019; and so on &#x2013; comprising over a hundred topics and more than eight hundred sub-topics.* A model of orderly arrangement and organization, it is entirely lacking in the provisional, highly contingent and ultimately unsustainable (&#x2018;a lot else&#x2019;) quality of Evans&#x2019;s catalogue of his own intentions.<br><br>Some of Evans&#x2019;s best-known work was done under the auspices of the Farm Security Administration between 1935&#x2013;37. Known first as the Resettlement Administration, this was one of Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal agencies aimed at improving the lot of poor farmers and sharecroppers brought to the brink of starvation by the Depression. The FSA was headed by the economist Rexford Tugwell who, in 1935, appointed his old teaching assistant Roy Stryker to run the Historical Section. Both men were convinced of the power of photographs to give a human reality to economic arguments but it was not until the fall of that year, when Stryker was granted sole responsibility for making a photographic record of the agency&#x2019;s policy and work, that he got a clearer sense of his task &#x2013; and of his power. This was brought into still sharper focus when he saw some photographs that had already been commissioned. They&#x2019;d been done by Evans and were sufficiently impressive to secure the photographer the post as Stryker&#x2019;s Senior Information Specialist. Evans viewed this appointment as a kind of &#x2018;subsidized freedom&#x2019;, but, like many of the other photographers working for Stryker (Ben Shahn, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Arthur Rothstein, among others), he found his freedom compromised by the patron who had bestowed it. As Stryker&#x2019;s sense of his mission grew he issued more and more exacting &#x2018;shooting scripts&#x2019;, broken down by season, often sub-divided by location, itemizing in extraordinary detail what he wanted photographing. Here is an excerpt from a script for &#x2018;Summer&#x2019;:<br>Crowded cars going out on the open road. Gas station attendant filling tank of open touring and convertible cars.<br><br>Rock gardens: sun parasols; beach umbrellas; sandy shores with gently swelling waves; whitecaps showering spray over sailboat in distant horizon.<br><br>People standing in shade of trees and awnings. Open windows on street cars and buses; drinking water from spring or old well; shady spot along bank &#x2013; sun on water beyond; swimming in pools, rivers, and creeks.<br>Under &#x2018;American Habit&#x2019;, photographers of &#x2018;Small Town&#x2019; life were instructed to look out for: &#x2018;R.R. station &#x2013; watching the train &#x201c;go through&#x201d;; sitting on the front porch; women visiting from porch to street; cutting the lawn; watering the lawn; eating ice-cream cones; waiting for the bus . . .&#x2019; In the &#x2018;City&#x2019; they were pointed towards &#x2018;park bench-sitting; waiting for street car; walking the dog; women with youngsters in park or sidewalk; kids&#x2019; games . . .&#x2019; All of this was to be supplemented by &#x2018;General&#x2019; shots: &#x2018;&#x2018;&#x2018;fill &#x2019;er up&#x201d; &#x2013; gas in car; &#x201c;flats fixed&#x201d;; traffic jam; detour sign; &#x201c;Men Working&#x201d; . . . Orange drink. Bill posters; sign painters &#x2013; crowd watching a window sign being painted. Sky writing . . . Parade watching: ticker tape; sitting on curb . . .&#x2019;<br><br>There is a particular poetry &#x2013; the poetry of comprehensive contingency &#x2013; about these scripts, and the fact that they now read as captions shows how diligently, if begrudgingly, Stryker&#x2019;s photographers did his bidding. Stryker supplemented his scripts with still more precise orders to make good any omissions. &#x2018;Where are the elm-shaded streets?&#x2019; he asked Russell Lee, in Amarillo, Texas, in 1939. On another occasion Lee was asked to look out for &#x2018;a small town barber shop where they still have the individual [shaving cream] cups with Mr Citizen&#x2019;s name on each cup&#x2019;. Having told Arthur Rothstein, in Denver, to look out for &#x2018;Raking and burning leaves. Clearing up the garden. Getting ready for winter&#x2019;, Stryker added, as an afterthought: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t forget people on front porches either.&#x2019; While fulfilling Stryker&#x2019;s orders photographers such as Evans and Lange brought their own private agendas to bear so that, at times, the resulting pictures represent a hybrid or merging of distinct categorical requirements.<br><br>In the 1950s Evans became friendly with the young Swiss photographer Robert Frank whom he encouraged to apply for a Guggenheim fellowship. In support of his application Frank came up with his own, highly individualized list of things he might photograph:<br>a town at night, a parking lot, a supermarket, a highway, the man who owns three cars and the man who owns none, the farmer and his children, a new house and a warped clapboard house, the dictation of taste, the dream of grandeur, advertising, neon lights, the faces of the leaders, and the faces of the followers, gas tanks and post offices and backyards . . .<br>When the fellowship was awarded in 1955 Frank set out on a road trip across America, in the course of which he exposed nearly seven hundred rolls of film. After printing three hundred negatives Frank arranged the pictures into categories such as &#x2018;symbols, cars, cities, people, signs, cemeteries . . .&#x2019; By the time the resulting book, The Americans, was published (in France in 1958; in the States the following year) only traces of this preliminary order could be seen. There were still pictures of cars and cemeteries but the book was no longer arranged around the intended categories.<br><br>In the full knowledge that there are other, more sensible ways to organize a book I take my cue from these highly contingent, provisional, often abandoned attempts rather than the methodical approach of Hine. As Robert Frank put it in his Guggenheim application, &#x2018;the project I have in mind is one that will shape itself as it proceeds, and is essentially elastic.&#x2019; Dorothea Lange also believed that &#x2018;to know ahead of time what you&#x2019;re looking for means you&#x2019;re then only photographing your own preconceptions, which is very limiting.&#x2019; As far as she was concerned it was fine for a photographer to work &#x2018;completely without plan&#x2019; and just photograph &#x2018;that to which he instinctively responds&#x2019;. Taking Lange at her word I tried as far as possible to be open to anything, &#x2018;like a piece of unexposed, sensitized material&#x2019;. Certain pictures caught my eye, just as certain things happened to catch the eye of the photographers who took them in the first place. Initially chance played a key part in both processes. After a point, though, I began to see that a number of these photos had something in common &#x2013; a hat, say &#x2013; and once I became aware of this I started to look out for pictures of hats. I wanted my take on photography to be arbitrary, incidental, but at some point things necessarily coalesced under particular areas of interest. As soon as I realized I was drawn to hats the idea of the hat became an organizing principle or node.<br><br>It is inherent in the idea of a taxonomy that the categories are distinct, that there is no overlap between, say, cats and dogs. Whether because the taxonomy has decreed this to be the case or because it reflects an inbuilt distinction is a moot point; either way there is no such thing as a dat or cog or a dog-cat. (Foucault blahs on about this in the preface to The Order of Things &#x2013; that&#x2019;s why the Borges encyclopedia provoked a &#x2018;laughter that shattered all the familiar landmarks of [his] thought&#x2019;.) One of the features of this photographic taxonomy is that there is a great deal of seepage or traffic between categories. No sooner had I established hats and steps as organizing principles than I saw that some of the pictures that had engaged my attention had both hats and steps in them.* (These, not surprisingly, were some of the most interesting photographs to me.) Once this started happening the static grid of the taxonomy began to melt into the looser, more fluid form of narratives or stories. And while a taxonomy is expected to be comprehensive and disinterested, I knew right away that my own interests were best served by being &#x2013; in both senses of the word &#x2013; partial.<br><br>I suspect, then, that this book will be a source of irritation to many people, especially those who know more about photography than I do. I&#x2019;m sympathetic but, if we&#x2019;re to make any progress at all, there&#x2019;s one kind of criticism I&#x2019;d like to rule out of court straightaway. This is the &#x2018;But what about X?&#x2019; or &#x2018;Why didn&#x2019;t he mention Y?&#x2019; charge of inadmissible omission. Can we agree, in Whitman&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;that much unseen is also here&#x2019;, that it&#x2019;s not necessary to discuss &#x2013; or even mention &#x2013; every picture ever taken of a hat in order to learn something interesting about pictures of hats? I hope so, because the person doing the learning is the person writing the book as much as the person reading it. The driver is along for the ride too. For Henri Cartier-Bresson photography was &#x2018;a way of comprehending&#x2019;. This book is the story of my attempt at comprehending the medium that he mastered.<br><br>John Szarkowski thought Garry Winogrand&#x2019;s best pictures &#x2018;were not illustrations of what he had known, but were new knowledge.&#x2019; I wanted, among other things, to look at photographs to see what new knowledge I could derive from them &#x2013; though I couldn&#x2019;t do this without bringing a certain amount of old knowledge to bear on them. I also wanted to learn more about &#x2013; or at least become more sensitive to &#x2013; the differences between certain photographers, to get more of an idea of their styles. To see if style could be identified in and by &#x2013; if it inhered in &#x2013; content. The only way to do this was to see how different people photographed the same thing.<br><br>In the process this book has ended up being mainly &#x2013; but not exclusively &#x2013; about American photographs, or at least photographs of America. This was not my intention. At the outset I didn&#x2019;t have any particular photographers &#x2013; or photographs for that matter &#x2013; in mind. Everyone and anything was eligible. There were photographers I&#x2019;d not heard of and pictures I&#x2019;d not seen (I make no claim to being an expert in this or any other field). There were important photographers I happened not to be interested in (Irving Penn, for one); there were photographers I&#x2019;d written about before or couldn&#x2019;t find anything new to say about (Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa, for two); there were photographers I thought I&#x2019;d write about at length (Eug�ne Atget, and we&#x2019;ll stop the counting right there) but ended up writing about only briefly; there were photographers I didn&#x2019;t intend writing about but ended up writing about quite a bit. One of these was Michael Ormerod in whose work several of the book&#x2019;s themes culminate. This was a lucky and entirely unintended break. He&#x2019;s the author&#x2019;s embedded representative: an Englishman undertaking a survey of American photography.<br><br>Ormerod had the advantage of doing this within the medium, through photographs themselves, but I&#x2019;m not a photographer. I don&#x2019;t just mean that I&#x2019;m not a professional or serious photographer; I mean I don&#x2019;t even own a camera. The only time I take a picture is when tourists ask me to take one of them, with their camera. (These rare works are now dispersed around the world, in private collections, mostly in Japan.) It&#x2019;s a handicap, sure, but it does mean that I come to the medium from a position of some kind of purity. I also have a hunch that not taking photographs is a condition of writing about them in the same way that my not playing a musical instrument was a precondition for writing about jazz in the late 1980s. Back then there were few books around to satisfy my curiosity about the music and the people who created it. The situation with regard to photography could hardly be more different. There are great books on the idea of photography &#x2013; or, as Stieglitz put it, &#x2018;the idea photography&#x2019; &#x2013; by Susan Sontag, John Berger and Roland Barthes.* There are excellent book-length surveys of the history of photography or various genres and movements within that history. There are numerous books and essays of the highest standard about particular photographers by curators and scholars. Photographers themselves have also proved extremely eloquent about their medium. This made things a lot easier. With the bar set so high I was free to walk right under it. But I still hope, as Diane Arbus put it, that &#x2018;I have some slight corner on something about the quality of things.&#x2019;<br><br>Dorothea Lange said that &#x2018;the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.&#x2019; I might not be a photographer but I now see the kind of photographs I might have taken if I were one.</p><h2>The Detox Mono Diet: The Miracle Grape Cure and Other Cleansing Diets</h2><p>An introduction to the healing effects of fasting using just one type of food <br><br>� Includes Johanna Brandt&#x2019;s grape cure with the author&#x2019;s advice and commentary <br><br>� Explains why mono diets are so effective at cleansing and restoring the internal cellular environment <br><br>� Shows how to interpret your body&#x2019;s signals to adapt the diet to your unique needs <br><br>The grape cure, the lemon cure, the maple syrup cure, and the apple diet are all variations of mono diets that are based on restricting food intake to one food for a period of time. Using the famous grape cure pioneered by Johanna Brandt as his model (reproduced here in its entirety), Christopher Vasey demonstrates why these restricted diets are all remarkably effective in healing illness and restoring optimum health. Despite their different nutritive approaches and resulting healing benefits, all these diets work the same way: They help the body &#x201c;burn&#x201d; the waste products it contains to cleanse the internal cellular environment. They also keep the body&#x2019;s eliminatory organs open in order to prevent the buildup of toxins.

So many people and so many health conditions can benefit from the approach found in Dr. Vasey&#x2019;s <em>The Detox Mono Diet</em>.&#x201d; <br>--Elson M. Haas, M.D., The Detox Doc, author of <em>The New Detox Diet</em> and <em>Staying Healthy with Nutrition <br> <br></em>The grape cure, the lemon cure, the maple syrup cure, and the apple diet are all variations of mono diets that are based on restricting food intake to one food for a period of time. Using the famous Grape Cure pioneered by Johanna Brandt as his model, Christopher Vasey demonstrates why these restricted diets are so effective in healing illness and restoring optimum health. Despite the different nutritive qualities of the chosen food, all these diets work the same way: They help the body &#x201c;burn&#x201d; the waste products it contains to cleanse the internal cellular environment. They also keep the body&#x2019;s eliminatory organs open in order to prevent the buildup of toxins. While these cures are responsible for healing people of many serious illnesses, including cancer, their principal use lies in the way they naturally enhance the body&#x2019;s health by eliminating waste products and preventing the body from absorbing toxins during this process. <br> <br><em>The Detox Mono Diet</em> is a practical guide that provides all the information necessary for following a detoxification regimen. To make the application most successful, the author explains how to interpret your body&#x2019;s reactions in a way that will allow you to adapt the cure to match your specific physiological needs, making your return to optimum health a unique journey. <br> <br>Christopher Vasey, N.D., is a naturopath specializing in detoxification and rejuvenation.

The stories of ten generations of Sackett men and women as they forged westward from tyranny-wracked seventeenth-century England across the American continent have captivated readers for three decades through seventeen novels with nearly forty millions copies in print. The traditions and adventures of this family of rugged individualists who stand indomitably united when any Sackett is in trouble have inspired country songs, a popular television miniseries starring Tom Selleck (as Orrin Sackett) and Sam Elliot (as Tell Sackett), thousands of reader queries&#x2014;and now, a rare full-length work of non-fiction by the worlds' all-time best-selling frontier novelist.<br><br> In a <i>60 Minutes</i> profile in which he hailed Louis L'Amour as "our professor emeritus of how the West was won," correspondent Morley Safer observed that "his plots may be fiction but the details therein are fact." <i>The Sackett Companion </i>is the author's long-savored opportunity to present the research and probe the factors behind his Sackett fiction&#x2014;novel by novel&#x2014;and to elaborate on their real and fictional characters, their geography and locales, and their historical eras in encyclopedia-like detail.<br><br> In this book, subtitled <i>A Personal Guide To The Sackett Novels,</i> L'Amour takes us on a guided tour of his imagination to introduce us to the never-before-told sources and inspirations for these stories and the people and places that populate them. He retraces some of his travels in which he has walked the land the Sacketts walk, reliving such personal memories as the street fight he had on a hot dusty morning in New Mexico that ultimately led to the birth of the Sacketts.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.Introduction<br> &nbsp;<br> A question I am often asked is: How long does it take to write a book?<br> &nbsp;<br> It seems to me a ridiculous question. If the questioner stopped to think, he or she would understand that it takes as long as is necessary. Is the book to be two hundred pages or two thousand? Is much research required or very little? No book can be written without some research, for no matter how much one believes he knows, it will always prove to be less than enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> I rarely do research on a book I am writing. That research has, except for the unexpected detail, been done long before. By the time I begin to write, I am saturated with the background of my story. Yet one never knows enough. There is always more to be learned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another question I am asked at least once a month or during the question-and-answer period at a lecture: What book can I read to learn about the West?<br> &nbsp;<br> What part of the West? During what period? <br> &nbsp;<br> What phase of western settlement?<br> &nbsp;<br> I have read, scanned, or browsed through literally thousands of books, documents, diaries, and reports and am only beginning to understand what happened; how, why, when, and where it happened; to say nothing of all the problems and influences that contributed to what the West was at various stages in history.<br> &nbsp;<br> No story of the frontier can be written without knowledge of the physical environment, of the terrain, vegetation, animal, and insect life. Each state differs from every other, and within each state there are many widely diverse environments. Montana is unlike Texas, and both differ in many respects from Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, or Colorado.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Plains states present other problems, as do those rimming the Pacific. Oddly enough, some readers have never realized that California was as much a cowboy state as any other, and her vaqueros were among the greatest riders and ropers this country ever saw. It was second in cattle population only to Texas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oregon, Washington, and Idaho had their big ranches, their stagecoach hold-ups, and gunfighters, so the West was and is a very large area, indeed.<br> &nbsp;<br> To really know the western frontier requires a lifetime of study. And there will always be those unexpected pockets of history that have developed in relative isolation so far as the reading public is concerned.<br> &nbsp;<br> The western American frontier went through many phases of development. The Spanish who settled in the Southwest and the French in the North and Northwest were the first. Then the so-called Long Hunters (because they were out a long, long time!) ventured west of the Appalachians. Daniel Boone, who is considered by many to be the original western pioneer, was, in fact, preceded by many others. Gabriel Arthur was living with the same Indians Boone was to meet, but one hundred years earlier, and he was but one of many.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our histories are based largely upon official or semi-official reports that appeared at a time when only a small number of people could read and write. Few of the hunters and explorers even thought of writing what had happened to them or where they had been. In our western histories, and indeed, in the history of the world, we are basing all our conjectures on only a small number of accounts. Moreover, most of these come from a relatively few countries; reports from elsewhere in the world are rarely considered.<br> &nbsp;<br> At a rough guess, I would estimate that ninety percent of the fiction written about the West has concerned the Plains states or those few others that were in the cattle business or provided a trail westward that moved from Missouri to California. For some reason the man on horseback has always intrigued, whether he be knight in armor, a Bedouin of the desert, or an American cowboy. He has always been a figure of romance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is it because he is mobile? Because he can ride away into the sunset? Or that he comes from out of nowhere, a mysterious, romantic figure who appears without warning and is seemingly free of everyday trials and troubles?<br> &nbsp;<br> Contemporary man has tried to substitute the car for the cow pony, but it simply doesn&#x2019;t work. True, in a car he is mobile, and once behind the wheel he can feel the excitement of command, but nevertheless the car is bound to the road, inhibited by traffic, and frustrated by regulations essential to his safety but which he often feels rob him of the true freedom he wants.<br> &nbsp;<br> To write well of the West there is so much one should know. Horses, cattle, weapons, the way a saddle was rigged, the way a cowhand used a rope, and the lifestyles of Indians varied greatly from place to place.<br> &nbsp;<br> The English saddle, for instance, was intended for the hunt or for brief rides, but a cowhand lived in his saddle from daylight until dark. It was not only where he spent a major part of his life, it was his workbench, and had to be structured as such. The ancestor of the cowboy saddle was that of the armored knight who needed a secure seat, or the Conquistador who followed Cortes, Coronado, and their kind. These men established settlements in New Mexico, with churches and schools, long before the Pilgrims landed in 1620.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for the importance of physical environment: the land itself was always present in the thoughts, the emotions, and calculations of the pioneer. No story of the West can be written where the terrain is not a factor. The distance from here to there, the existence of waterholes, the condition of the grass, the trails (if any existed), and many other factors had to be considered. The country demanded consideration in any pioneer&#x2019;s plans, but it also exerted its influences on the emotions. Many simply could not stand the rolling plains that seemed to go on forever with a vast sky arching overhead. Many turned and ran for cover in city streets or small villages where they had lived. Some went insane from the ever-blowing wind and the isolation of life on a government claim.<br> &nbsp;<br> To write well of the West one must understand not only what happened here, but what caused it to happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> My own western experience began with stories told by my grandfather, who had fought in the Civil and Indian Wars; my father, who had grown up with a Huron Indian as his only playmate; and an uncle who came to visit at least twice when I was very young. He was an uncle by marriage, a man born with a wanderlust and no desire to own or possess. In his lifetime he covered much of the West from British Columbia to Sonora. He delivered mail, punched cows, managed a large ranch, and did just about everything a man could do in western country.<br> &nbsp;<br> My father was a veterinarian who worked largely with farm or ranch stock, and doubled as a deputy sheriff for a number of years, off and on. As a veterinarian, one of his jobs was the inspection of cattle shipped through on the Northern Pacific Railroad, and frequently, when I was very young I went with him to the stockyards, listening to his conversations with the cowboys who were riding east with the cattle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, at the age of fifteen, when I started to make my own way in the world, I worked on ranches, in mines, on construction gangs, and in the sawmills and lumber woods. Often I worked beside men who had lived through the younger, wilder days of America&#x2019;s growing years.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a child I learned to listen and remember, and later, sitting around cow camps and in mining towns, I listened more than I talked. The men and women I met were the survivors. Some survived by skill, some by chance, I learned, as my questions or comments helped revive memories. I had already acquired an interest in everything western.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I knew I would be a writer and a teller of tales, I had no idea of writing about the West. It was simply that the stories I heard were exciting, and it was simply that I was interested. The collectors of oral history today would give their eyeteeth for what I was hearing nearly every day, and I&#x2019;d have given mine for any kind of a recording device, but I had to rely on my memory.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes today I am not sure just where I learned something, remembering the information but not the source. Miners I worked with had before my time worked the mines from Butte to Tombstone, from Cripple Creek and Tonopah to Grass Valley. Now they are gone, and the old cattlemen are gone too, taking their memories with them. Four of the old-time gunfighters I knew passed on down the trail in the 1940s, another in &#x2019;53. As I&#x2019;ve said elsewhere, &#x201c;if you didn&#x2019;t shoot &#x2019;em they&#x2019;d live forever.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If I have written good stories, much is due to those with whom I worked or saw around town, and who contributed their bits of western lore or their memories of the old days and the people who lived them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Often their opinions varied, and often what they told me in later years was colored by hearsay, but it was what was believed at the time. All this must be weighed in the balance with newspaper accounts, diaries, or other documentation. Somewhere out of it all comes something resembling the truth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Occasionally there will be an &#x201c;old-timer&#x201d; who has told the same story so many times he believes it (and others do, too), telling you &#x201c;he was there!&#x201d;.<br> &nbsp;<br> One such story was an anecdote about Wyatt Earp in Dodge City. The only trouble with it was that Wyatt was a gambler in Silverton, Colorado when the so-called event took place and had not been in Dodge for over a year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diaries were and are important. They were written at the time events happened and represented the information at least as one man saw it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Diaries have been a rich source of material for me. Not the events recorded in such journals, but the mental attitude, the moral standards, and the feelings of people at the time. It is all right to imagine, but the imagination must have a takeoff point, it must have a basis in fact.<br> &nbsp;<br> Newspapers&#x2014;and nearly every western town had at least one&#x2014;are valuable sources. Often the reporting was good, and just as often the writing was opinionated, a fact one should easily detect, for people of the time&#x2014;and that included newspaper reporters&#x2014;made no secret of their opinions. Many a western editor set his type with a six-shooter on the table beside him, ready to back up his opinions, if need be.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Dylan&#39;s Redemption: Book Three: The McBrides</h2><p><p><em>There&#x2019;s a new sheriff in Fallbrook . . .

Willful. Charming. Blunt. Grace Coddington&#x2019;s extraordinary talent and fierce dedication to her work as creative director of <i>Vogue</i> have made her an international icon. Known through much of her career only to those behind the scenes, she might have remained fashion&#x2019;s best-kept secret were it not for <i>The September Issue,</i> the acclaimed 2009 documentary that turned publicity-averse Grace into a sudden, reluctant celebrity. Grace&#x2019;s palpable engagement with her work brought a rare insight into the passion that produces many of the magazine&#x2019;s most memorable shoots.<br> &nbsp;<br> With the witty, forthright voice that has endeared her to her colleagues and peers for more than forty years, Grace now creatively directs the reader through the storied narrative of her life so far. Evoking the time when models had to tote their own bags and props to shoots, Grace describes her early career as a model, working with such world-class photographers as David Bailey and Norman Parkinson, before she stepped behind the camera to become a fashion editor at British <i>Vogue</i> in the late 1960s. Here she began creating the fantasy &#x201c;travelogues&#x201d; that would become her trademark. In 1988 she joined American <i>Vogue,</i> where her breathtakingly romantic and imaginative fashion features, a sampling of which appear in this book, have become instant classics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Delightfully underscored by Grace&#x2019;s pen-and-ink illustrations, <i>Grace</i> will introduce readers to the colorful designers, hairstylists, makeup artists, photographers, models, and celebrities with whom Grace has created her signature images. Grace reveals her private world with equal candor&#x2014;the car accident that almost derailed her modeling career, her two marriages, the untimely death of her sister, Rosemary, her friendship with <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i> editor-in-chief Liz Tilberis, and her thirty-year romance with Didier Malige.

And druid circles. And hardly any trees. And bleakness. Although it was bleak, I saw beauty in its bleakness. There was a nice beach, and I had a little sailboat called Argo that I used to drift about in for hours in grand seclusion when it was not tethered to a small rock in a horseshoe-shaped cove called Trearddur Bay. I was fifteen then, my head filled with romantic fantasies, some fueled by the mystic spirit of Anglesey, the thinly populated island off the fogbound northern coast of Wales where I was born and raised; some by the dilapidated cinema I visited each Saturday afternoon in the underwhelming coastal town of Holyhead, a threepenny bus ride away, where the boats took off across the Irish Sea for Dublin and the Irish passengers seemed never short of a drink. Or two. Or three or four.<br><br> For my first eighteen years, the Trearddur Bay Hotel, run by my family, was my only home, a plain building with whitewashed walls and a sturdy gray slate roof, long and low, with the unassuming air of an elongated bungalow. This thirty-two-room getaway spot of quiet charm was appreciated mostly by holidaymakers who liked to sail, go fishing, or take long, bracing cliff-top walks rather than roast themselves on a sunny beach. It was not overendowed with entertainment facilities, either. No television. No room service. And in most cases, not even the luxury of an en suite bathroom with toilet, although generously sized white china chamber pots were provided beneath each guest bed, and some rooms&#x2014;the deluxe versions&#x2014;contained a washbasin. A lineup of three to four standard bathrooms on the first floor provided everyone else&#x2019;s washing facilities. For the entire hotel there was a single chambermaid, Mrs. Griffiths, a sweet little old lady in a black dress and white apron equipped with a duster and a carpet sweeper. I remember my mother being quite taken aback by a guest who took a bath and rang the bell for the maid to set about cleaning the tub. Why wouldn&#x2019;t the visitors scrub it out themselves after use? she wondered.<br><br> Our little hotel had three lounges, each decorated throughout in an incongruous mix of the homely and the grand, the most imposing items originating from my father&#x2019;s ancestral home in the Midlands. At an early age, I discovered that the Coddingtons of Bennetston Hall, the family seat in Derbyshire, had an impressive history that included at least two wealthy Members of Parliament, my grandfather and great-grandfather, and stretched back sufficiently into the past to come complete with an ancient family crest&#x2014;a dragon with flames shooting out of its mouth&#x2014;and a family motto, &#x201c;Nils Desperandum&#x201d; (Never Despair). And so, although some communal rooms remained modest and simple, the dining room was furnished with huge, inherited antique wooden sideboards decorated with carved pheasants, ducks, and grapes, and the Blue Room contained a satinwood writing desk hand-painted with cherubs. A large library holding hundreds of beautiful leather-bound books housed many display drawers of seashells, and various species of butterfly and beetle. There was a grand piano in the music room (from my mother&#x2019;s side of the family), and paintings in gilded frames&#x2014;dark family portraits&#x2014;hanging everywhere else.<br><br> Guests would rise with the sun and retire to bed at nightfall. If they needed to use the telephone, there was a public booth in the bar. There was a single lunchtime sitting at one o&#x2019;clock and another at seven p.m. for dinner, with only two waiters to serve on each occasion. Tea was upon request. Breakfast was served between nine and nine-thirty in the dining room&#x2014;and certainly never in the bedroom. There was also a games room with a Ping-Pong table where I practiced and practiced. I was good. Very good. I would beat all the guests, which didn&#x2019;t go down too well with my parents.<br><br> The sand on the long, damp beige ribbon of beach in front of the hotel was reasonably fine-grained but did get a bit pebbly as you approached the icy Irish Sea slapping against the shore. You could, however, paddle out for a fair distance before it became freezingly knee-deep.<br><br> Throughout my childhood I longed for the lushness of trees. Barely one broke the rocky surface on our side of the island. Only when we paid the occasional family visit to my father&#x2019;s aunt Alice in her big, shaded house on the south side would we ever see them in numbers. My great-aunt was extremely frail and old, so I always think of her as being about a hundred. Her house was close to the small town of Beaumaris, which had a huge social life in the 1930s. My parents met there, as my mother lived nearby with her family in a sprawling house called Trecastle.<br><br> Flanking our hotel on one side was a gray seascape of cliffs, rocks, and bulrushes, then acres of windswept country and a lobster fisherman&#x2019;s dwelling, and on the other Trearddur House, a prestigious prep school for boys. Once I reached the age when boys became of interest, I used to linger shyly, watching them play football or cricket beyond the gray flinty stone wall bordering their playing fields until I arrived at the bus stop and took off on my winding journey to school.<br><br> We were open from May to October but the hotel was guaranteed to be one hundred percent full only during the relatively sunny month of August, the time of the school summer holidays. Many vacationing families from the not too distant towns of Liverpool and Manchester made the effort to come and stay with us because, although it might have been easier for them to reach the more accessibly popular holiday spots of North Wales, our charming beach and village were that much more individual. At other times we were mostly empty or visited by parents who had come to join their sons for special events at the school.<br><br> Each year tumultuous clouds and fierce equinox gales announced the end of summer. A mad scramble then ensued to rescue all the little wooden sailing boats about in the bay belonging to the locals that bobbed. Llewellyn, the lobster fisherman, was in charge of having them hauled out of the sea and beached beneath the protective seawall. All winter long, while we were closed, thick mists enveloped us and rough seas pounded our shoreline. The entire place became desolate. On foggy nights you could hear the sad moan of a foghorn coming from the nearby lighthouse. It hardly ever snowed, but it rained most of the time: a constant drizzle that made the atmosphere incredibly damp, the kind of dampness that gets into your bones. So damp that, as a child, I swear I used to ache all over from rheumatism.<br><br> In the afternoons, I took long walks along the cliffs with Chuffy, my mother&#x2019;s Yorkshire terrier, and Mackie, my sister&#x2019;s Scottie. Stormy waves foamed and crashed over the gray rocks along the seafront, and if you missed your timing, you were liable to come in for a complete drenching whenever you dashed between them.<br><br> Throughout the endless weeks of winter, the hotel was so deserted it wasn&#x2019;t worth the bother of switching on the lights. My sister and I would play ghosts. Wrapped in white sheets, we hid along the dark, empty corridors, each containing many mysterious, shadowy doorways from which you could jump out and say, &#x201c;Boo!&#x201d; We would wait and wait, the silence broken only by the tick-tock, tick-tock, of our big grandfather clock. But in the end, I couldn&#x2019;t stand the gloom, the suspense of waiting, the sinister ticking. It was too scary, so I usually fled to the warmth and comfort of the fireside.<br><br> I was born on the twentieth of April 1941 in the early part of World War II, the same year the Nazis engulfed Yugoslavia and Greece. I was christened Pamela Rosalind Grace Coddington. My elder sister Rosemary, or Rosie for short, was the one who choose Pamela as my registered first name, which then became abbreviated to Pam by most people we knew.<br><br> Marion, my maternal grandmother, was a Canadian opera singer who had fallen in love with my grandfather while visiting Wales on a singing tour. He followed her back to Canada, where they married and where my mother and her brother and sister were born. For a while they lived on Vancouver Island, which was heavily wooded and filled with bears. Then they moved back permanently to Anglesey, where my grandmother grew more and more morose and wrote terribly sad poetry. I&#x2019;m told my grandfather was somewhat extreme when it came to what he perceived as correct behavior. Apparently, he once locked my grandmother in the downstairs bathroom&#x2014;which he had designated for gentlemen only&#x2014;for an entire day when she had used it in an emergency.<br><br> Janie, my mother, inherited this strict, no-nonsense Victorian attitude and believed that children should be seen and not heard. She demanded absolute obedience but never lost her temper or raised her voice. It was a given that I would make my bed and tidy my room, and that I had my chores to fulfill. She was the strong, stoic one who held our family together. Photographs of her from the 1920s show a sleek and prosperous-looking woman. She drew and painted rather well in watercolors and played the piano and the Spanish guitar. Welsh&#x2014;although she preferred to think of herself as English&#x2014;she could trace the family lineage back to the Black Prince. (In fact, we weren&#x2019;t encouraged to think of ourselves as Welsh at all; more as foreigners, �migr�s from Derbyshire.)</p><h2>Slave in A Box: The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima (The American South Series)</h2><p><p>The figure of the mammy occupies a central place in the lore of the Old South and has long been used to ullustrate distinct social phenomena, including racial oppression and class identity. In the early twentieth century, the mammy became immortalized as Aunt Jemima, the spokesperson for a line of ready-mixed breakfast products. Although Aunt Jemima has undergone many makeovers over the years, she apparently has not lost her commercial appeal; her face graces more than forty food products nationwide and she still resonates in some form for millions of Americans.</p><p>In Slave in a Box, M.M. Manring addresses the vexing question of why the troubling figure of Aunt Jemima has endured in American culture. Manring traces the evolution of the mammy from her roots in the Old South slave reality and mythology, through reinterpretations during Reconstruction and in minstrel shows and turn-of-the-century advertisements, to Aunt Jemima's symbolic role in the Civil Rights movement and her present incarnation as a "working grandmother." We learn how advertising entrepreneur James Webb Young, aided by celebrated illustrator N.C. Wyeth, skillfully tapped into nostalgic 1920s perceptions of the South as a culture of white leisure and black labor. Aunt Jemima's ready-mixed products offered middle-class housewives the next best thing to a black servant: a "slave in a box" that conjured up romantic images of not only the food but also the social hierarchy of the plantation South.</p><p>The initial success of the Aunt Jemima brand, Manring reveals, was based on a variety of factors, from lingering attempts to reunite the country after the Civil War to marketing strategies around World War I. Her continued appeal in the late twentieth century is a more complex and disturbing phenomenon we may never fully understand. Manring suggests that by documenting Aunt Jemima's fascinating evolution, however, we can learn important lessons about our collective cultural identity.</p></p><p><p>M.M. Manring is an independent scholar living in Columbia, Missouri.</p>The troubling figure of Aunt Jemima, the "simple, earnest smiling mammy" who currently adorns more than 40 food products manufactured by Quaker Oats, is now over 100 years old. With origins in the "mammies" of the antebellum South and in the minstrel shows (where she was played by white men in drag and blackface) and magazine ads of the early 1900s, Aunt Jemima has undergone various makeovers, independent scholar Manring notes. However, she landed her present incarnation as benevolent pancake maker through the attempts of ad men James Webb Young and N. C. Wyeth in the 1920s to capitalize on white nostalgia for the "leisure" of the plantation system. Geared for middle-class homemakers, Aunt Jemima's "ready-mixed" breakfast thus served as a "slave in a box," according to Manring. Though rid of her bandanna and toothy grin by the 1960s, Aunt Jemima remains a metaphor for whites' idealized relations between the races, with a nonthreatening, asexual elderly black woman happily serving the powers that be. A careful cultural study of this familiar image of Americana, Manring's analysis covers broad-ranging materials from popular fiction, folk songs, movies and ads, as well as historical events such as the 1893 World's Fair and Disney's theme park opening in 1955 of "Aunt Jemima's Pancake House." The book is less concerned with tracing a "strange career," however, than with the way marketing strategies can both mirror and create white fantasies. Aunt Jemima's static character only underscores the intractability of cultural change when moving product has the upper hand over social conscience. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sudden Terror</h2><p>This book is based on the actual case of the East Area Rapist, later also known as the Original Night Stalker, a masked man who terrorized California communities for ten years; 1976 through 1986, and possibly to this day. Because I was not involved in the initial rape investigations, they are written from hundreds of reports, notes, memos, newspaper clippings, conversations and interviews with those who were involved. The crimes are factual. The crimes are real. While all characters and events have direct counterparts in the telling of the story, I have created some dialogue in the interest of readability. The cops in the initial rapes are not factual, their actions are. Their names and descriptions are completely fictitious. The names of the victims, witnesses and suspects are fictitious; the terror, the dialogue during the crimes, and the investigations are real. The cops involved in the cases after I was involved are real, their names and dialogue is factual, the investigations are real. The pain and terror may have diminished in the minds of the victims, I hope that the pain does not return. My intent is to tell the story without endangering the privacy or the dignity of the victims. They have suffered enough.</p><p>Larry Crompton was born in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, graduating from St. Stephen High School in 1957.

The outcome is pivotal. If Hitler's forces are not stopped, Russia will fall. And with it, the world....<br><br>German soldiers call the battle <i>Rattenkrieg,</i> <b>War of the Rats</b>. The combat is horrific, as soldiers die in the smoking cellars and trenches of a ruined city. Through this twisted carnage stalk two men&#x2014;one Russian, one German&#x2014;each the top sniper in his respective army. These two marksmen are equally matched in both skill and tenacity. Each man has his own mission: to find his counterpart&#x2014;and kill him. <br><br>But an American woman trapped in Russia complicates this extraordinary duel. Joining the Russian sniper's cadre, she soon becomes one of his most talented assassins&#x2014;and perhaps his greatest weakness. Based on a true story, this is the harrowing tale of two adversaries enmeshed in their own private war&#x2014;and whose fortunes will help decide the fate of the world.</p><p>David L. Robbins grimly recounts the merciless determination of the German and Soviet combatants of the battle of Stalingrad in <i>War of the Rats</i>. Drawing from real events, Robbins tells the story of one of the battle's most pivotal contests: the famous sniper duel between Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitsev and S.S. Colonel Heinz Thorvald. Zaitsev, a cunning Siberian hunter hardened by Stalingrad's butchery, has formed an impromptu sniper school in the midst of the battle, training his comrades to kill with implacable efficiency. The hundreds of bodies left in their wake prompt the Nazi leadership to send Thorvald, the cold-blooded master of the Wehrmacht's elite sniper academy, to assassinate the Soviet prodigy. Robbins's nerve-wracking prose depicts the two adversaries as they pursue their private war across a twisted hellscape of burning tanks and gutted factories. In the novel's most impressive section, Robbins leaps between the thoughts of Zaitsev and Thorvald as they struggle, in their final battle, to put the crosshairs on each other's head. A war novel that reveals the shrewd savagery in human nature, <i>War of the Rats</i> vividly reveals why the Germans referred to the fighting at Stalingrad as <i>Der Rattenkrieg</i>. <i>--James Highfill</i>David L.

McMurrin</h2><p><br>Available for the first time fifty years after the author&#x2019;s death, Studies of the Book of Mormon presents this respected church leader&#x2019;s investigation into Mormonism&#x2019;s founding scripture. Reflecting his talent for combining history and theology, B. H. Roberts considered the evident parallels between the&nbsp;Book of Mormon and Ethan Smith&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>View of the Hebrews</i>, a book that predated the Mormon scripture by seven years. If the Book of Mormon is not historical, but rather a reflection of the misconceptions current in Joseph Smith&#x2019;s day regarding Indian origins, then its theological claims are suspect as well, Roberts asserted.&nbsp;<br><br>In this and other research, it was Roberts&#x2019;s proclivity to go wherever the evidence took him, in this case anticipating and defending against potential future problems. Yet the manuscript was so poorly received by fellow church leaders that it was left to Roberts alone to decide whether he had overlooked some important piece of the puzzle or whether the Mormon scripture&#x2019;s claims were, in fact, illegitimate. Clearly for most of his colleagues, institutional priorities overshadowed epistemological integrity.&nbsp;<br><br>But Roberts&#x2019;s pathbreaking work has been judged by the editor to be methodologically sound&#x2013;still relevant today. It shows the work of a keen mind, and illustrates why Roberts was one of the most influential Mormon thinkers of his day. The manuscript is accompanied by a preface and introduction, a history of the documents&#x2019; provenances, a biographical essay, correspondence to and from Roberts relating to the manuscript, a bibliography, and an afterword&#x2013;all of which put the information into perspective.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br>Brigham Henry Roberts, born in England in 1857, was president of the LDS First Quorum of the Seventy and assistant church historian.

There were few people in the world he considered as difficult as Noelle.<br><br>Actually, he couldn't think of <em>one.</em><br><br>"Did you hear me?" Morgan Thorpe, his assistant, stood at the entrance to his office wearing an impatient frown. Noelle (who still used his last name, which bothered him, since they'd been together for only a year) hadn't been able to reach him on his cell. She'd tried three times in the past fifteen minutes and he'd let it go to voice mail. So she'd called his business line, which he'd specifically asked her not to do. He didn't like the way she aired her complaints about him&#x2014;and everything else&#x2014;to anyone who'd listen.<br><br>His employees didn't like it, either.<br><br>"I heard," he replied.<br><br>"Are you going to take her call? Because if I have to talk to her again, I'm going to tell her exactly what I think of her."<br><br>He gave Morgan a look to make sure she understood that would be a mistake. At forty-five, she wasn't old enough to be his mother, but she often took a maternal approach with him, probably because she'd been working for him since he started First Step Solar. He'd hired her the same week she came out of the closet and moved in with her partner, who was as soft-spoken as Morgan was bold. "No, you're not."<br><br>"Why?" she cried. "Noelle's a terrible person! She deserves whatever she gets!"<br><br>"We were once married. We still live in the same small town. We can figure out some way to get along."<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "If it's that easy, why are you avoiding her?"<br><br>She had a point. Dodging Noelle's calls wouldn't do him any good, anyway. She'd just track him down at his house or even a restaurant, if she had to. She did that kind of thing all the time&#x2014;to plead for an advance on his spousal maintenance, a "small loan" to prevent her utilities from being turned off or money to get her car repaired. Once, she'd even asked him for five hundred bucks to go toward fixing her boob job (apparently, her body kept rejecting the implants, but instead of having them removed, she kept trying to make them work). It didn't seem to matter that none of that was his responsibility anymore.<br><br>"Put her through," he said with a sigh.<br><br>"That woman is <em>insufferable.</em> I don't know how you tolerate her," Morgan grumbled as she left.<br><br>He didn't, either.<br><br>He glanced at the light blinking on his desk phone. Surely Noelle would find someone else and get remarried. He wished that would happen soon. It would save him $2,500 a month, not to mention the relief of not having to deal with her anymore. But he'd been wishing that for the past five years, ever since the divorce. He was beginning to suspect that as long as she had him to pay a hefty chunk of her monthly bills, she'd be unlikely to tie the knot with someone else. She wasn't the type to part with a freebie. Besides, she saw his financial support as punishment for the fact that he'd never been able to love her&#x2014;and, truth be told, he saw it in the same light. That was why he'd agreed to that amount and why he helped her out as often as he did. Guilt demanded it.<br><br>"Someday," he muttered as he picked up.<br><br>"Someday what?" Noelle asked.<br><br>Someday he'd be rid of her. But he couldn't say that. "Nothing. What's going on? Why have you been blowing up my phone?"<br><br>"Why are you ignoring my calls?" she countered.<br><br>"Because I can't think of any reason you'd need to talk to me. We <em>are</em> divorced, remember? And with all the money I've given you over the past few years&#x2014;in the past several months alone&#x2014;I'm a good six months ahead in my payments. That pretty much leaves you with no excuse."<br><br>"It's my water heater," she said.<br><br>"Your <em>what?"</em><br><br>"My water heater."<br><br>She'd found something new to complain about? "What's wrong with it?"<br><br>"It went out on me. I can't take a shower or do laundry or dishes. I don't have any hot water."<br><br>He rocked back in his chair. "Then...shouldn't you be looking up a plumber instead of bothering your ex-husband?"<br><br>"Why are you being rude? I'm calling because you happen to own a solar manufacturing plant. Can't you give me a deal on a solar system? So I can get my hot water bill down?"<br><br>"I manufacture <em>photovoltaic</em> panels, Noelle. They run air conditioners and other <em>electrical</em> appliances. Anything that requires gas is a whole separate thing." They'd been <em>married,</em> for God's sake, and she still didn't understand what he did for a living?<br><br>"You have connections for hot water systems, too. You put one in for Brandon and Olivia's neighbor."<br><br><em>Why</em> had they told her he'd done that? "Mrs. Stein is nearly eighty and she lost her husband a year ago. I saw that she got a deal. That's all."<br><br>"You bought it from the manufacturer at wholesale and let her have it at cost. And your <em>photovoltaic</em> installers put it in for her."<br><br>"Because she could use the break. Brandon asked me to help her out. Occasionally, I do favors like that for my brother."<br><br>"Come on. You didn't do it for Brandon's sake."<br><br>Irritation clawed deeper, causing his eye to twitch. "Of course I did. We've been getting along great," he said, and that was true. He and Brandon had once been rivals. They hadn't met until they were in high school, when Brandon's mother married Kyle's father. Two large-and-in-charge boys so close in age would understandably have a difficult period of adjustment. But the dynamic was different these days. In spite of everything that'd happened back then, and with Noelle and Olivia since, Kyle cared about Brandon. He got the impression Brandon cared, too. At least, he heard from his stepbrother quite a bit. He also saw Brandon and Olivia every Friday at Black Gold Coffee. They'd joined the close-knit group of friends Kyle had grown up with.<br><br>"Quit lying to yourself," she spat. "You'd do anything for Olivia. The way you stare after her when she leaves a room&#x2014;or you avoid looking at her if you're in the same room&#x2014;makes it <em>so</em> obvious. They'd see it themselves, except they don't <em>want</em> to see it."<br><br>His blood pressure shot a little higher. "Fine," he said. "You want a solar hot water system? I'll offer you the same deal I gave Brandon and Olivia's neighbor."<br><br>She seemed startled that he'd capitulated so suddenly. But there wasn't any point in refusing. She'd never be able to afford it. Besides, he didn't want to talk about Olivia. What Noelle said was true. Olivia was her sister&#x2014;which was a big part of the reason Noelle had gone after him in the first place&#x2014;but Olivia had been, and still was, the one great love of his life. She'd been with him before she'd ever been with Brandon.<br><br>"That's better," Noelle said. "So...how much will it cost? I have nearly $250 in my account."<br><br>She stated that amount proudly. She wasn't good at saving money, so this did signify quite a feat. But, as usual, she was completely clueless&#x2014;or, more likely, <em>cal-culatedly</em> clueless. "That's what I thought," he said.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You don't have enough to buy even a traditional water heater."<br><br>"I don't?" She sounded dismayed. "How much are they?"<br><br>"A decent one will run you eight hundred or more."<br><br>"And how much is solar?"<br><br>"Nearly three grand."<br><br>"You've got to be kidding me!" she cried. "How do you expect me to pay that?"<br><br>"I don't expect you to pay it. You need to drive over to the hardware store and see what's in your price range."<br><br>"In other words, you don't give a shit whether I'm in a bind."<br><br>His head was beginning to pound... "I'm sorry your water heater died, but it's not <em>my</em> problem."<br><br>"You can't help me?"<br><br>Morgan tapped the glass between her workstation and his office and made a face at him.<br><br>He waved her away. "What do you expect me to do?"<br><br>"A solar hot water system can't cost <em>you</em> that much," she replied.<br><br>"It can and it does. Check the retail price and you'll see it's around six grand. Wholesale would be about half of that."<br><br>"Then maybe you can put one in and let me make payments."<br><br>"We're divorced! And you're only renting. Call your landlord."<br><br>"Harry won't do anything. He's letting me stay here for a lot less than he'd charge someone else. Why do you think he gave me such a good deal?"<br><br>"Because he's your cousin?"<br><br>"Because in order to get that deal, I have to take care of all maintenance and repairs."<br><br>"Then it's on you."<br><br>"If you can't get me solar, can you at least help me pay for a regular water heater? From what you just told me, I only need another $550. What're a few hundred bucks to you? You make so much more than I do!"<br><br>"That doesn't mean <em>I'm</em> obligated to pay for it. You got extra money out of me last month. <em>And</em> the month before."<br><br>"Because I needed a D&amp;C, Kyle. I've been having female trouble ever since I lost the baby. <em>Remember?"</em><br><br>As usual, she'd chosen something he had to be careful not to question. That didn't stop him from wondering, however. Had she really needed a D&amp;C? Or were the documents she'd shown him forged? It could be that he'd paid for another boob job, after all. He wasn't even sure she'd lost the baby that had supposedly created the need for a D&amp;C. Had she even had a "miscarriage" five and a half years ago? Maybe she'd aborted it. He'd always suspected her of lying, suspected that after she got him to marry her, she'd purposely terminated the pregnancy. At that point, she wouldn't see any reason to risk damaging her figure, which she protected above all else.<br><br>"I remember," he said through gritted teeth. He didn't want to talk about that, either. It was easier to bury the doubt and the suspicion and try to forget the past.<br><br>"You don't care."<br><br>Maybe he would if he believed it was true. But with Noelle&#x2014;who could say? Whenever she needed money, she came up with an excuse he'd be hard-pressed to decline&#x2014;medical treatment, that she'd be evicted, that she wouldn't have electricity or food.<br><br>"Look, I paid for the procedure," he said. "That's all that matters. I hope you're feeling better. Now I've got to go. I have a lot to do here&#x2014;"<br><br>"Wait! What about my water heater?"<br><br>"What about it?" he asked in exasperation.<br><br>"You seriously won't give me a small loan? Then will you let me stay in the farmhouse until I can get it fixed on my own?"<br><br>No way was she coming anywhere near his property. She would <em>never</em> live there. "Absolutely not. I've got the farmhouse cleaned up and ready to lease."<br><br>"But it's been ready to lease for two months, and it's sat empty that whole time. Why not let me move in until I'm back on my feet? You're not likely to get someone now."<br><br>What was she talking about? "Why not?"<br><br>"The holidays. People are busy with shopping and wrapping and decorating."<br><br>"Not everyone. Matter of fact, I have someone coming to see it tonight. He's ninety percent sure he wants it. He just has to see it in person to confirm. Then he'll sign."<br><br>"Who is it?" she asked.<br><br>Kyle checked the information he'd jotted on his desk calendar. "Guy by the name of Meade."<br><br>"Never heard of him..."<br><br>"He's from Nashville. Only needs it for a few months, but he asked me to furnish it, so&#x2014;"<br><br>"Furnish it with what?" she broke in. "It's not like you have a furniture warehouse."<br><br>"There are companies that rent furniture. I called a place in Sacramento, chose some items from their website, and they brought it all out. The place is move-in ready now. Looks great."<br><br>"You went to that much trouble for someone who's only staying for a few months? I thought you wanted a year's lease. That's what you told me when <em>I</em> asked about it."<br><br>"He's paying a premium&#x2014;for the furniture, my time and trouble in acquiring it <em>and</em> the short term. Even if he decides he hates the house and I have to send the furniture back, he's covering all of that. In any case, you didn't lose out, because I wouldn't let you move in, no matter what." The past few months, she'd been trying her best to get back with him. The last thing he needed was to allow her to be that close&#x2014;not to mention he'd never see a dime of rent.<br><br>"Even though I'd be willing to sign for a year?"<br><br>"Even if you'd be willing to sign for ten."<br><br>"You can be so mean," she said.<br><br><em>Mean?</em> He thought he was being incredibly nice&#x2014;considering that merely talking to her made him want to punch himself in the face. "We've talked about this before. I'll take Meade's deal, if I can get it, and try to find another tenant next summer, when school's out."<br><br>"That's great for you, but what about me? Can't I use it until he moves in?"<br><br>The childlike whine that entered her voice made his eye-twitch worse. <em>Patience,</em> he reminded himself. <em>Breathe deeply and speak kindly.</em> "He hasn't said when that'll be. But since he's coming all the way from Tennessee to look at it, I'm guessing he could move in tonight."<br><br>"In the middle of the storm that's coming in?"<br><br>"Why not? He'll just carry in his luggage. How hard can that be, whether there's a storm or not?"<br><br>"So you're going to leave me in the lurch&#x2014;the woman who would've been the mother of your child if that child had survived?"<br><br>Before he could respond, Morgan knocked briskly and opened the door. "Don't tell me you're still on with her."<br><br>He sent her a frown that told her to mind her own business, but she didn't leave.<br><br>"I have a call from LA," she said. "Some guy wants a special deal on a 10-megawatt order."<br><br>Which was such a big order, no one at his company could provide the pricing but him. He changed the phone to his other ear. "Noelle, I've got to go."<br><br>"I can't believe you're doing this!"<br><br>"What else am I supposed to do?"<br><br>"You have the contacts. You could get me a water heater and let me make payments, if you weren't so stingy."<br><br>"Kyle?" Morgan prompted, reminding him&#x2014;as if he needed her to&#x2014;of the far more important caller on the other line.<br><br>He almost told Noelle to go down to the hardware store and have the checker call him for his credit card information. He wanted to get rid of her, and they'd done that kind of remote purchase before, when someone threw a rock through her window (likely the girlfriend of someone she'd flirted with at Sexy Sadie's). But the more he gave her, the more she'd keep coming back to him. He had to break the cycle.<br><br>Fortunately, he thought of a solution that should've been obvious to him from the start. "I've got a water heater here," he said. "It's the one I took out of Brandon's neighbor's house. If you'll have someone pick it up and install it, I'll give it to you."<br><br>"You're sure it works?"<br><br>Morgan propped her hands on her hips and scowled at him, refusing to leave until he took that business call.<br><br>"It did when my guys removed it. No reason that should've changed. She wanted solar mainly to be responsible to the environment." He'd been planning to donate the water heater to a poor family who could use it. But Noelle fit the bill. She didn't have much money, despite juggling two jobs. Working in retail part-time, and then as a barmaid nights and weekends, she didn't make a whole lot. What she did earn, she spent on clothes and beauty aids.<br><br>"Okay. Thanks." Noelle lowered her voice. "I'm happy to oblige if you'd like...<em>something</em> in return."<br><br>"I don't need anything," he said.<br><br>"You sure about that?"<br><br></p><h2>The Luminous Eye: The Spiritual World Vision of Saint Ephrem the Syrian (Cistercian Studies)</h2><p>All but unknown outside the Syrian tradition, Ephrem&#39;s rich theology of symbol, asceticism, and prayer amply deserves to stand beside his more famous Greek contemporaries.</p><p>A book to transform our thinking about theology.The Living Church<br><br>. . . an invaluable introduction to the thought of Ephrem accessible to a wider reading audience . . . the most reliable and comprehensive orientation to the thought of the Syrian Master.Religious Studies Review</p><h2>Sorry For My Familiar Vol. 2</h2><p><p><b>ROAD TRIP IN ANOTHER WORLD</b></p><p>Devil girl Patty and her human familiar Norman have been traveling across the Devil World in search of Patty&#x2019;s trouble-making father.

But on the chosen day, Duggan is found shot to death and Macbeth is rumored to be the likely suspect. Macbeth must find the murderer, clear his name, and restore his Highland paradise to its usual tranquility.</p><p>M. C. Beaton has won international acclaim for her New York Times bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries. The BBC has aired 24 episodes based on the series. Beaton is also the author of the bestselling Agatha Raisin series, which will air as an eight-episode dramatic series on Sky1, starring Ashley Jensen. She lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. For more information, you can visit MCBeaton.com.Hamish Macbeth, one-man police force of Lochdubh village in the Scottish Highlands, is in trouble again (Death of a Nag, 1995, etc.), with archenemy Chief Inspector Blair still trying to orchestrate his downfall. For some time, the village has been home to one Randy Duggan, nicknamed Macho Man, whose past is mysterious and who regales the bar regulars with tales of his wrestling triumphs--his massive fists ready for action at the slightest provocation. Hamish has accepted his challenge to a fight (strictly against regulations), and the whole village comes out to watch. When Duggan fails to show, it's fisherman Archie MacLean who finds him in his cottage--hands bound, shot to death. Hamish does his best to scout Duggan's true identity and questions the villagers who had close contact with him, as well as the newcomer Rosie Draly, a romance author rumored to be writing a detective story. Days after that interview, Hamish finds Draly stabbed to death, her computer disks destroyed. Draly's killer is soon nailed, thanks to Hamish's persistence in tracking the evidence, and confesses to Duggan's murder as well. The police brass are satisfied but not Hamish. He carries on his own investigation in disguise, going all the way to Glasgow, where he finds another corpse; commandeers a civilian plane back to Lochdubh; and arrives just in time to save the life of sometime girlfriend Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, and to wind up the case--his way. The rambling, shambling plot has some suspenseful patches; Lochdubh's locals are as entertaining as ever; and Hamish is at his charming, exasperating best. Mid-level Beaton, and that's not bad. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Heroes out of legend joined his quest: Chareos the Blademaster, Beltzer the Axeman, and the bowmen Finn and Maggrig. And one among their company hid a secret that could free the world of Nadir domination. That one was the Nadir Bane, the hope of the Drenai.

We haven't taken him up on the offer. However, David has also acknowledged that three of his major influences were Louis Lamour, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stan Lee. Tolkien wrote back, Lamour passed away before David had any opportunity to contact him, and Stan Lee lived thousands of miles away from David's British home. One out of three wasn't bad, but it could be improved upon.<br><br>We were at the San Diego ComicCon, rustling up new readers, and David had just finished a two-hour continuous signing. A friend of mine spotted a familiar face, so I excused myself and darted away, returning a few moments later to say, "David Gemmell, I'd like you to meet Stan Lee." A tall, ruddy, and normally poised individual, David was struck speechless. Here was the man who, through his Marvel Comics stories, had reinvented the relationship between heroes and villains, forever blurring the barriers between good and evil. Before long the two fantasists were chatting away happily. Stan's wife, Joan, being British, was especially gracious to the London-born Gemmell. And Stan quickly demanded an autographed copy of LEGEND.<br><br>David's a dynamic storyteller. His lands live and breathe. His heroes are mighty swordsmen, ax-wielders, and post-apocalyptic adventurers. In their prime they were the best in the business, but in David's tales, they've often passed their prime, so all they really want is peace and quiet. But life (and the author) aren't that kind, and these heroes are forced out of retirement, forced to face bloody hordes of the undead, armies from Hell. Worse, his heroes are generally saddled with young, green heroes. (Nothing drives you crazy more than a cocky kid.) But they overcome, and the cocky kids become heroes, too.

But out of this turmoil emerged a center of black progress, optimism, and cultural ferment.

Having survived a deadly race riot in 1866, Church constructed an empire of vice in the booming river town. He made a fortune with saloons, gambling, and&#x2015;shockingly&#x2015;white prostitution. But he also nurtured the militant journalism of Ida B. Wells and helped revolutionize American music through the work of composer W.C. Handy, the man who claimed to have invented the blues.</p><p>In the face of Jim Crow, the Church fortune helped fashion the most powerful black political organization of the early twentieth century. Robert and his son, Bob Jr., bought and sold property, founded a bank, and created a park and auditorium for their people finer than the places whites had forbidden them to attend.</p><p>However, the Church family operated through a tense arrangement with the Democrat machine run by the notorious E.

Rowing to Latitude is a lyrical, vivid celebration of these northern journeys and the insights they inspired.

Somehow, more than twenty thousand miles have slid under our blades, a function of time and repetitive motion rather than undue strength or bravery. Once, far down the Yukon River, which begins in western Canada and cleaves Alaska, an old Athabascan subsistence fisherman hailed us from his aluminum skiff. In keeping with local custom, he was in no hurry to talk, preferring to drift in silence while his eyes appraised us through a poker mask of wrinkles. In time he asked, "Where you come from?" And a minute or two later, "Where you go?" More silence, while he digested our answers. Eventually he pronounced, "You must be plenty rich tospend the summer paddling." Doug leaned back, grinned, and replied without a trace of the awkwardness I feared was lit in neon upon my face, "If we were rich, we'd have a boat with a motor like yours." Though we are far from rich and occasionally prey to bouts of motor envy, paddling is our preferred mode of travel, at least until our joints completely disintegrate. It allows us to tickle the shoreline, and opens our senses to the rhythms around us. We are more attuned to our surroundings when we are moving at only five miles per hour, maybe six on a good day. With hours to think, it is also a little harder to escape from ourselves. We always travel in two boats. This gives us an extra margin of safety and allows us to carry several months' worth of supplies. More important, such separation keeps us from hating each other. It would take better people than we are to share a small boat day after day and then to crawl into the same tent night after night, for weeks on end. Until 1994, there was also the practical consideration that we propelled our boats differently. I am firmly committed to rowing, which does not allow any part of my body to ride for free. My legs, when confined by the spray skirt of a kayak, instantly begin to twitch, and my arms feel cast in bronze. Doug favored kayaking for the first thirteen thousand of the miles we journeyed together; oddly, he thought it was important to see where he was going. But at last he converted, reluctantly acknowledging the greater efficiency and speed afforded by a sliding seat and long oars. Onlookers frequently remark that they would love to do similar trips if only they had the time, or the necessary experience. No matter how often I've heard these comments, they still give me pause. As for time, we give it a high priority; if we wait too long, we will be unable to row. And we've gained the experience by doing, stroke by stroke. Most often, though, people question why we undertake these trips at all. They might as well ask us why we breathe or eat. Our journeys are food for our spirits, clean air for our souls. We don't care if they are firsts or farthests; we don't seek sponsors. They are neither a vacation nor an escape, they are a way of life. On a trip down the Yukon River in 1987, we made a habit of asking Native people who lived along its shores how far up- and downriver they had traveled. Usually they had ranged less than fifty miles in either direction--some a little farther in these days of snowmachines and skiffs with hefty outboard engines. Just over halfway down the river, however, at about the twelve-hundred-mile mark, we met Uncle Al, an Athabascan elder. He was slightly stooped with age but straightened when he answered, brown eyes aglow. As a young man, he said, he had traveled by canoe all the way to the headwater lakes, and had also followed the river a thousand miles from his home to the sea. When we asked why, he looked puzzled. "I had to know where the river came from and where it was going." We give a version of the same answer. We do these trips because we need to. The world of phones, computers, and deadlines cannot compare with singing birds, breaching whales, magnificent light shows, and crackling ice. If, on the day I took possession of my first ocean shell from the canopy of a dusty truck, someone had informed me that I would row more than enough miles to take me to the far side of the world and back, I would have marveled at the notion. As with most burgeoning ventures, this book also began innocently, as a holiday letter sent annually to friends, family, and those who had helped us along the way. The letters were evidently passed along through a maze of unseen channels. Before long, we began to receive requests from people we'd never heard of to add their names to our mailing list. If laziness or a hectic avalanche season caused us to miss a year, we'd end up fielding phone calls fromobscure corners of the world from people who were sure we had met one too many polar bears. Still, I shared the skepticism of the round-faced Inupiaq man who, weary of passing visitors to the Arctic declaring themselves instant experts, invited us to his house for whale blubber only after I had assured him in good faith that I was not writing a book. It was not until our stories began to take on a life of their own--retold to us by people unaware of their origins and unlikely ever to find themselves experiencing the expanse of the Arctic firsthand--that the stirrings of the book within became much harder to ignore. In the last few years, I've felt increasing urgency to give voice to the caribou that graze without fear along the Labrador shore, to the wide-shouldered brown bears of the Alaska Peninsula who depend upon the annual migration of salmon, to fjords uncut by roads or power lines. Doug and I are drawn to northern latitudes not out of sheer perversity, as our families claim, but because we seek wild country. The prevailing nasty weather of the sub-Arctic and Arctic can be a great deterrent to both dense settlement and tourism. But during our travels, we've witnessed the lengthening shadow of our civilization's influence over remote corners of the natural world. What finally galvanized me into writing, though, was an even more tangible reminder of the fragility of all that surrounds us. When my mother was diagnosed with advanced cancer, she said, "You have to write this book before I die." I responded, "All right, but you have to live a long time." In the process of journeying, we seem to have become the journey, blurring the boundaries between the physical landscape outside of ourselves and the spiritual landscape within. Once, during a long crossing in Labrador, we found ourselves in fog so thick that it was impossible to see even the ends of our boats. Unable to distinguish gray water from gray air, I felt vertigo grabhold of my equilibrium, and the world began to spin. I needed a reference point--the sound of Doug's voice or the catch of my blades as they entered the water--to know which way was right side up. Rounding thousands of miles of ragged shoreline together, driven by the joys and fears of not knowing what lies around the next bend, has helped us to find an interior compass. Doug and I have awoken many Alaska winter mornings inside cabins so fogged with the warm vapor of our dreams that we couldn't tell if the dark shape outside the window was a moose or a tree. To bring the object outside into clearer view, we had to start within, scraping a hole in the frost with our fingernails. This book begins much the same way. <i>Copyright � 2001 by Jill Fredston</i></p><h2>Wonder Woman Vol. 3: The Truth (Rebirth)</h2><p>WONDER WOMAN VOL. 3: THE TRUTH is the latest chapter of the instant-classic saga from writer Greg Rucka and artist Liam Sharp. <br> &nbsp;<br> They say the truth will set you free.

Now in its first paperback edition, the psychological thriller features Dominic Matei, an elderly academic who experiences a cataclysmic event that allows him to live a new life with startling intellectual capacity. Sought by the Nazis for their medical experiments on the potentially life-prolonging power of electric shocks, Matei is helped to flee through Romania, Switzerland, Malta and India. Newly endowed with prodigious powers of memory and comprehension, he finds himself face to face with the glory and terror of the supernatural. In this surreal, philosophy-driven fantasy, Eliade tests the boundaries of literary genre as well as the reader&#x2019;s imagination.<br> <br> Suspenseful, witty, and poignant, <i>Youth Without Youth</i> illuminates Eliade&#x2019;s longing for past loves and new texts, his erotic imagination, and his love of a thrilling mystery. It was adapted for the screen in 2007 as Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s first feature film in over ten years.<br> <br> &#x201c;A wonderful blend of realism, surrealism, and fantasy, [Eliade&#x2019;s novellas] suggest the importance of the mythic and the supernatural to finding meaning in the everyday.

In <em>No Magic Bullet,</em> Allan M. Brandt recounts the various medical, military, and public health responses that have arisen over the years--a broad spectrum that ranges from the incarceration of prostitutes during World War I to the establishment of required premarital blood tests.<br><br>Brandt demonstrates that Americans' concerns about venereal disease have centered around a set of social and cultural values related to sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and class. At the heart of our efforts to combat these infections, he argues, has been the tendency to view venereal disease as both a punishment for sexual misconduct and an index of social decay. This tension between medical and moral approaches has significantly impeded efforts to develop "magic bullets"--drugs that would rid us of the disease--as well as effective policies for controlling the infections' spread.<br>In the paper edition of <em>No Magic Bullet,</em> Brandt adds to his perceptive commentary on the relationship between medical science and cultural values a new chapter on AIDS. Analyzing this latest outbreak in the context of our previous attitudes toward sexually transmitted diseases, he hopes to provide the insights needed to guide us to the policies that will best combat the disease.<br></p><p>This book is devoted to tracing the historical record of this distinctive set of infectious diseases from the late nineteenth century to current epidemics of herpes and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<br><strong>Allan M.

Professor Dively&#x2019;s scholarship investigates how intersections of creativity and composition theory may illuminate how individuals negotiate transitions between various academic composing contexts&#x2015;from high school to college classrooms, from general education to discipline-specific writing courses, from status as undergraduate student to graduate student, from status as graduate student to professional. Such interests generated a book-length empirical study entitled Preludes to Insight: Creativity, Incubation and Expository Writing (Hampton Press, 2006), as well as various articles and conference presentations.

Here too is a major selection of what Poe characterized as the passion of his life, his poems - "The Raven," "Annabel Lee," Ulalume," "Lenore," "The Bells," and more, plus his glorious prose poem "Silence - A Fable" and only full-length novel, <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</i>.</p><p>In his short, troubled life Edgar Allan Poe originated the mystery story, brought new psychological depth to the tale of horror, and made inimitable contributions to Romantic poetry and literary criticism. Born in Boston in 1809 to itinerant actors, Poe was orphaned as an infant and sent to live with a Richmond merchant, John Allan. Allan sent him to the University of Virginia in 1826, but Poe withdrew because of gambling debts. In 1830, with his first book of poems already published, he entered West Point but was dishonorably discharged the next year. In 1835 Poe was chosen editor of the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>. Poe was already established as an author when, in 1845, the publication of "The Raven" made him famous. He began to lecture, engaged in a celebrated feud with Longfellow, and became sole proprietor of his own magazine, <i>Broadway Journal</i>. But in 1846 the magazine went bankrupt, and in 1847, after years of suffering, Poe's wife died of consumption. His ill health and drinking worsened. In October 1849 he was found semiconscious outside a polling place in Baltimore; a few days later he died without regaining consciousness. <br><br>Ignored for the most part by his countrymen, he was idolized by the French Symbolists, who thought of him as the first modern poet and helped to win him the recognition that is now his.The Tell-Tale Heart<br>TRUE!--NERVOUS--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I can tell you the whole story.<br><br>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture--a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.<br><br>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with what caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to work!<br><br>I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it--oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!--would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the hinges creaked)--and I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night just at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.<br><br>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. <br><br>Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.<br><br>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out--"Who's there?"<br><br>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.<br><br>Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief--oh no!--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself--"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him, had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head within the room.<br><br>When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily--until, at length, a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.<br><br>It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but <br><br>I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.<br><br>And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.<br><br>But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!--do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.<br><br>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.<br><br>I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all--ha! ha!<br><br>When I made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock--still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart--for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night: suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.<br><br>I smiled,--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.<br><br>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:--it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definitiveness--until at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.<br><br>No doubt I now grew very pale;--but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations, but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observation of the men--but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore. I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder--louder--louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But any thing was better than this agony! Any thing was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!--and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder!--<br><br>"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up the planks!--here, here!--it is the beating of his hideous heart!"<br>The Black Cat<br>FOR THE most wild yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburden my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them. To me, they have presented little but horror--to many they will seem less terrible than baroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the commonplace--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.<br><br>From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. <br><br>To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.<br><br>I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.</p><h2>Tales of Wrykyn</h2><p>The stories in this collection reflect Wodehouse&#39;s own happy schooldays at Dulwich College but they also do a good deal more. Although among his earliest attempts at fiction they give fascinating glimpses of a time when motor cars were novelties, schoolmasters wore mortar boards and gowns, and America was a rising power in the world. The best of them display the author&#39;s love of games and knack for neat plotting. In one, a resourceful teenaged heroine helps a truant schoolboy cricketer by marooning his credulous schoolmaster at the top of a church tower until the match is over. Another describes a boy escaping from the scene of his crime by a passing car, only to be caught out by a last-minute revelation. Several Sherlock Holmes parodies read as what they are - high-spirited experiments - but the longer stories delve deeper into character: together, they recreate a vanished world of school shops, fagging, Latin prep and hearty teas.</p><p>P. G. Wodehouse (1881&#x2013;1975) spent much of his life in Southampton, New York, but was born in England and educated in Surrey. He became an American citizen in 1955.

Befriended by Donatello, a young Italian with the classical grace of the "Marble Faun," Miriam, Hilda, and Kenyon find their pursuit of art taking a sinister turn as Miriam's unhappy past precipitates the present into tragedy.<br> <br> Hawthorne's 'International Novel' dramatizes the confrontation of the Old World and the New and the uncertain relationship between the 'authentic' and the 'fake' in life as in art. The author's evocative descriptions of classic sites made <em>The Marble Faun</em> a favorite guidebook to Rome for Victorian tourists, but this richly ambiguous symbolic romance is also the story of a murder, and a parable of the Fall of Man. As the characters find their civilized existence disrupted by the awful consequences of impulse, Hawthorne leads his readers to question the value of Art and Culture and addresses the great evolutionary debate which was beginning to shake Victorian society.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Writing for a wide audience, David Harvey, author of <em>The New Imperialism</em> and <em>The Condition of Postmodernity</em>, here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage. Through critical engagement with this history, he constructs a framework, not only for analyzing the political and economic dangers that now surround us, but also for assessing the prospects for the more socially just alternatives being advocated by many oppositional movements.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Harvey</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He formerly held professorial posts at Oxford University and The Johns Hopkins University, and has written extensively on the political economy of globalization, urbanization, and cultural change. Oxford University Press published his book 'The New Imperialism' in September 2003 (reissued in paperback February 2005).<br><br>"Harvey's book is deeply insightful, rewarding and stimulating. His history of neoliberalism may indeed be brief, but the richness and profundity of this volume is without question."--Michael J. Thompson, <em>democratiya</em><p></p><br>"Presents a concise but extremely well-documented economic history of the last three decades, encompassing not only the usual G-7 countries but the entire world, with a particular emphasis on the US and capitalist China."--<em> Brian Holmes, Interactivist Info Exchange</em><p></p><br>"David Harvey has done it again. He has provided us with the most lively, readable, comprehensive, and critical guide to what might be called 'the condition of neoliberalism', uncovering its origins, tracing its spread around the globe, and exposing its devastating effects on the vast majority of people everywhere."--Leo Panitch, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Political Economy, York University, Toronto<p></p><br>"With characteristic brilliance, David Harvey offers a razor-sharp analysis of the history and current condition of neoliberalism. In an intellectually extraordinary <em>tour de force</em>, he dissects the contradictions between the freedoms offered by neoliberalism and the liberties desired by the people. This book convincingly demonstrates how neoliberalism restores class power, flirts openly with authoritarianism, and undermines democratic impulses. With democracy under siege, freedom's prospect resides squarely in the struggle for new political governance. A must read if you want to know the state we are in and how to change it."--Erik Swyngedouw, Professor of Geography, University of Oxford<p></p><br>"This book compellingly challenges arguments praising the supposed advantages of neoliberalism. This is particularly important when the claim that there is no alternative to neoliberal restructing has been largely accepted... Harvey 's assessment of the shortcomings of neoliberalism and the practices used to distract attention from these shortcomings is indispensable to discussions of neoliberal policies."--Aaron Peron Ogletree, J.D. <em>The Journal of Buddhist Ethics</em> and <em>The Electronic Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"Leave it to David Harvey to brilliantly summarize in little more than 200 pages what has taken more than thirty years to emerge as a political-economic form of governance."--<em>The Professional Geographer</em><p></p><br>"The many strengths of <em>A Brief History of Neoliberalism</em> cannot be adequately conveyed in this short space, but include powerful analyses of the devastating impact of neo-liberalism on the environment and labouring conditions (especially for women), a nuanced perspective on the external and internal forces compelling states to turn towards neo-liberalism, and the ways in which Marx's concept of "primitive accumulation" is highly pertinent to the neo-liberal era of capitalism."--<em>Labour/Le Travail</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Designing Disney&#39;s Theme Parks: The Architecture of Reassurance</h2><p>From the day it opened in July 1955, in an event given live TV coverage, Disneyland has been a key symbol of contemporary American culture. It has been both celebrated and attacked as the ultimate embodiment of consumer society, a harbinger of shopping-mall culture, a symbol of American hegemony in entertainment, the epitome of fantasy, simulation, pastiche, and the blurring of distinctions between reality and mass-media imagery. Yet for all the power of Disneyland as metaphor, almost no one has discussed the making of this unique place, with its far-flung colonies in Florida, Japan, and France. Written to accompany an exhibition at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal, <i>Designing Disney's Theme Parks: The Architecture of Reassurance</i> is the first book to look beyond the multiple myths of Disneyland.<br><br>Uniting a roster of authors chosen from wide-ranging disciplines, this study is the first to examine the influence of Disneyland on both our built environment and our architectural imagination. Tracing the relationship of the Disney parks to their historical forbears, it charts Disneyland's evolution from one man's personal dream to a multinational enterprise, a process in which the Disney "magic" has moved ever closer to the real world. Editor Karal Ann Marling, Professor of Art History and American Studies at the University of Minnesota, draws upon her pioneering work in the Disney archives to reconstruct and analyze the intentions and strategies behind the parks. She is joined by Marty Sklar, Vice Chairman and Principal Creative Executive of Walt Disney Imagineering, historian Neil Harris, art historian Erika Doss, geographer Yi-Fu Tuan, critic Greil Marcus, and architect Frank Gehry to provide a unique perspective on one of the great post-war American icons.<br></p><p><b>Karal Ann Marling</b> is Professor of Art History and American Studies, University of Minnesota;<br><b>Neil Harris</b> is Professor of History, University of Chicago;<br><b>Erika Doss</b> is Professor of Fine Arts, University of Colorado at Boulder;<br><b>Yi-Fu Tuan</b> is Professor, Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin;<br><b>Greil Marcus</b> is the author of <i>Invisible Republic</i>,<i> Lipstick Traces</i>, and <i>Mystery Train</i>.<br></p><h2>Let&#39;s Review Algebra 2/Trigonometry (Let&#39;s Review Series)</h2><p>This review book offers high school students in New York State advance preparation for the Regents Exam in Algebra 2/Trigonometry.

This volume brings back into print two original Craftsmen catalogs illustrating and describing a broad range of Stickley's furniture designs, complete with the original captions citing materials, dimensions, and prices.<br>Among the furniture shown are armchairs, rockers, stools, settees, desks, beds, music cabinets, drop-leaf tables, nests of tables, chests of drawers, sideboards, china cabinets and dressers. The other items offered in the catalogs include wicker baskets, fabrics, pottery, lamps, china, silverware, and glass.<br>With over 200 detailed illustrations and descriptions, these two catalogs, first published in 1912 and ca. 1915, are essential reference materials and identification guides for Stickley furniture. In addition, they offer social historians and students of Americana documentation of the new design trend and philosophy that swept America in the early years of the twentieth century, creating a bold break with the past and setting new directions in modern design.</p><p>Furniture maker and architect Gustav Stickley (1858-1942) was a leading spokesman for the American Craftsman movement, a design trend descended directly from the British Arts and Crafts movement.</p><h2>Music Matters: A New Philosophy of Music Education</h2><p>There is a mystery about music. On one hand, music making and music listening have occupied a prominent place in every culture since the dawn of recorded history and people everywhere continue to engage in a variety of musical experiences as part of their daily lives. Yet questions about the nature and value of music and its importance as a subject of education remain perplexing to many thinkers and are still hotly debated, even today. As a result, while music has been part of the school curriculum since antiquity, its profound contribution to general education has never been harnessed--until now.<br> What is music? Does music deserve a place in general education? If so, why? <em>Music Matters</em> builds new answers to these basic questions through a wide-ranging examination of music as a diverse human practice. The result is a ground-breaking philosophy of music education that provides critically reasoned perspectives on the nature and significance of performing, listening, musicianship, multiculturalism, creativity, consciousness, curriculum development, and more. Indeed, <em>Music Matters</em> is exceptional for the attention it pays to many aspects of music and education that previous music education doctrine either misses or ignores altogether. Following an incisive critique of past thinking, this important text develops a multidimensional concept of music that explains why music making and listening are unique forms of thinking and unique sources of the most important kinds of knowing that human beings can gain. In a richly detailed narrative that examines a wealth of recent philosophical and psychological research, the author constructs a compelling philosophical foundation that allows teachers to affirm to themselves and others that music deserves a central place in the education of all people. Among the many working ideas of this new philosophy is a distinctive concept of "curriculum-as-practicum" that explains how music educators can fulfill their educational mandate.<br> Invaluable as a core text for courses on foundations of music education or philosophy of music education at both the undergraduate and graduate level, <em>Music Matters</em> provides educators with critically reasoned perspectives on the "why, what, and how" of music teaching and learning, arguing convincingly that music is one of the most vital, dynamic, and practical pursuits in the human repertoire and, therefore, fundamental to the full development of the individual and collective self.</p><p>David J. Elliott is a Professor of Music Education and Graduate Adviser for Music Education, New York University."A very provocative book. This is an important addition to the music education library."--Steven J. Morrison, University of Washington<br><br>"This book will help guide music education into the next century!"--Scott Emmons, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee<br><br>"Music education historians will find much food for thought in Elliott's book....[H]is is a true philosophy of music education, not a philosophy of music or a rationale for music education masquerading as a philosophy....His work must be cheered as by far the most sophisticated philosophy of<br>music education to date. It takes into account many of the positive things that are being achieved by music education, and points the way toward improvements in the future. [It] may cause music education historians to consider the role of paradigms in the philosophy of music education, in their own<br>historical research, and in historical research in general."--Jere T. Humphreys, Arizona State University, in The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education<br><br>"David J. Elliott's Music Matters should prove to be a watershed in the history of our profession, because the author dramatically takes issue with some of the most cherished assumptions of mainstream philosophy in music education today....Elliott is exceptionally well- and widely-read,<br>incorporating a wealth of information from diverse sources....[He] has produced a book that will stimulate discussion well into the future. It should be read by all music educators..."--Music Educators Journal<br><br>"Brilliant, thought-provoking, stimulating! Should be required reading for all music education students and teachers."--Robert Garofalo, Catholic University of America<br><br>"A readable, thought-provoking resource for reflection on the philosophical basis of Musical Education."--Doris Herlein, Grand Valley State University<br><br>"Graduate students in our program are all in-service music teachers. They find Music Matters very accessible. Ideas presented by Elliott provoked thoughtful discussions about the role of music education in today's schools."--Margaret Schmidt, St. Cloud State University<br><br>"Bravo, David Elliott! You've provided an important addition to the required reading list of those sincerely interested in the teaching/learning process in music!"--Bernard Dobroski, Dean, Northwestern University School of Music<br><br>"It is a delight as well as a benefit to the profession to have a philosophical foundation that is both comprehensive and still focused on music education."--Thomas Goolsh, University of Washington<br><br>"[This text] escapes the growing dilemmas of past important past works, and brings a useful organization of newer views to a philosophy of music education for the coming generation."--James Rouintree, Anderson University</p><h2>Foundations of Algorithms</h2><p>Foundations of Algorithms, Fifth Edition offers a well-balanced presentation of algorithm design, complexity analysis of algorithms, and computational complexity.

Todd, PhD, Director, Marriage and Family Therapy Program, Adler School of Professional Psychology<br><br>"Selekman's book has a common-sense approach that is very much reflected in its straightforward title. The 12 chapters are divided into logical sections ranging from discussion of the background to his selected therapies and assessment techniques, through to suggestions for working with complex difficulties and implications for the future....There are plenty of examples of Selekman's way of working, along with an abundance of illustrations and ideas. Each step of his therapeutic process is described in an honest and unpretentious way, and he also aims to create transparency in this respect, including how he manages ethical and cultural issues. The case examples are particularly useful for demonstrating how an intervention could work in practice, including dilemmas and pitfalls, and it was useful and informative to have the background, rationale, and theory set out around them....This is an easily readable book, with straightforward language, which offers numerous suggestions and strategies that can be incorporated into therapy sessions by counsellors, therapists, and psychologists wishing to expand their repertoire of skills and interventions. I found the book refreshingly useful in practical terms, and would recommend it to practitioners as a readily accessible resource they could tap into for ideas to further help children and families to create positive changes and foster loving, caring relationships."
